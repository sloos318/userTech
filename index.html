            <h1>THE ANTICHRIST</h1>
            <h2>By Friedrich Nietzsche</h2>
            <p>Translated by H. L. Mencken</p>
            <p>The first sketches for “The Will to Power” were made in 1884, soon after
                <span class="pagenum" title="Page 8"> </span><a id="Page_8"></a>the publication of the first three parts of “Thus Spake Zarathustra,”
                and thereafter, for four years, Nietzsche piled up notes. They were
                written at all the places he visited on his endless travels in search of
                health—at Nice, at Venice, at Sils-Maria in the Engadine (for long his
                favourite resort), at Cannobio, at Zürich, at Genoa, at Chur, at
                Leipzig. Several times his work was interrupted by other books, first by
                “Beyond Good and Evil,” then by “The Genealogy of Morals” (written in
                twenty days), then by his Wagner pamphlets. Almost as often he changed
                his plan. Once he decided to expand “The Will to Power” to ten volumes,
                with “An Attempt at a New Interpretation of the World” as a general
                sub-title. Again he adopted the sub-title of “An Interpretation of All
                That Happens.” Finally, he hit upon “An Attempt at a Transvaluation of
                All Values,” and went back to four volumes, though with a number of
                changes in their arrangement. In September, 1888, he began actual work
                upon the first volume, and before the end of the month it was completed.
                The Summer had been one of almost hysterical creative activity. Since
                the middle of June he had written two other small books, “The Case of
                Wagner” and “The Twilight of the Idols,” and before the end of the<span class="pagenum" title="Page 9"> </span><a id="Page_9"></a> year
                he was destined to write “Ecce Homo.” Some time during December his
                health began to fail rapidly, and soon after the New Year he was
                helpless. Thereafter he wrote no more.</p>
                <p>The Wagner diatribe and “The Twilight of the Idols” were published
                immediately, but “The Antichrist” did not get into type until 1895. I
                suspect that the delay was due to the influence of the philosopher’s
                sister, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, an intelligent and ardent but by no
                means uniformly judicious propagandist of his ideas. During his dark
                days of neglect and misunderstanding, when even family and friends kept
                aloof, Frau Förster-Nietzsche went with him farther than any other, but
                there were bounds beyond which she, also, hesitated to go, and those
                bounds were marked by crosses. One notes, in her biography of him—a
                useful but not always accurate work—an evident desire to purge him of
                the accusation of mocking at sacred things. He had, she says, great
                admiration for “the elevating effect of Christianity ... upon the weak
                and ailing,” and “a real liking for sincere, pious Christians,” and “a
                tender love for the Founder of Christianity.” All his wrath, she
                continues, was reserved for “St. Paul and his like,” who<span class="pagenum" title="Page 10"> </span><a id="Page_10"></a> perverted the
                Beatitudes, which Christ intended for the lowly only, into a universal
                religion which made war upon aristocratic values. Here, obviously, one
                is addressed by an interpreter who cannot forget that she is the
                daughter of a Lutheran pastor and the grand-daughter of two others; a
                touch of conscience gets into her reading of “The Antichrist.” She even
                hints that the text may have been garbled, after the author’s collapse,
                by some more sinister heretic. There is not the slightest reason to
                believe that any such garbling ever took place, nor is there any
                evidence that their common heritage of piety rested upon the brother as
                heavily as it rested upon the sister. On the contrary, it must be
                manifest that Nietzsche, in this book, intended to attack Christianity
                headlong and with all arms, that for all his rapid writing he put the
                utmost care into it, and that he wanted it to be printed exactly as it
                stands. The ideas in it were anything but new to him when he set them
                down. He had been developing them since the days of his beginning. You
                will find some of them, clearly recognizable, in the first book he ever
                wrote, “The Birth of Tragedy.” You will find the most important of all
                of them—the conception of Christianity as<span class="pagenum" title="Page 11"> </span><a id="Page_11"></a> <i>ressentiment</i>—set forth at
                length in the first part of “The Genealogy of Morals,” published under
                his own supervision in 1887. And the rest are scattered through the
                whole vast mass of his notes, sometimes as mere questionings but often
                worked out very carefully. Moreover, let it not be forgotten that it was
                Wagner’s yielding to Christian sentimentality in “Parsifal” that
                transformed Nietzsche from the first among his literary advocates into
                the most bitter of his opponents. He could forgive every other sort of
                mountebankery, but not that. “In me,” he once said, “the Christianity of
                my forbears reaches its logical conclusion. In me the stern intellectual
                conscience that Christianity fosters and makes paramount turns <i>against</i>
                Christianity. In me Christianity ... devours itself.”</p>
                <p>In truth, the present philippic is as necessary to the completeness of
                the whole of Nietzsche’s system as the keystone is to the arch. All the
                curves of his speculation lead up to it. What he flung himself against,
                from beginning to end of his days of writing, was always, in the last
                analysis, Christianity in some form or other—Christianity as a system
                of practical ethics, Christianity as a political code, Christianity as
                meta<span class="pagenum" title="Page 12"> </span><a id="Page_12"></a>physics, Christianity as a gauge of the truth. It would be
                difficult to think of any intellectual enterprise on his long list that
                did not, more or less directly and clearly, relate itself to this master
                enterprise of them all. It was as if his <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original read ‘apostacy.’">apostasy</ins> from the
                faith of his fathers, filling him with the fiery zeal of the convert,
                and particularly of the convert to heresy, had blinded him to every
                other element in the gigantic self-delusion of civilized man. The will
                to power was his answer to Christianity’s affectation of humility and
                self-sacrifice; eternal recurrence was his mocking criticism of
                Christian optimism and millennialism; the superman was his candidate for
                the place of the Christian ideal of the “good” man, prudently abased
                before the throne of God. The things he chiefly argued for were
                anti-Christian things—the abandonment of the purely moral view of life,
                the rehabilitation of instinct, the dethronement of weakness and
                timidity as ideals, the renunciation of the whole hocus-pocus of
                dogmatic religion, the extermination of false aristocracies (of the
                priest, of the politician, of the plutocrat), the revival of the
                healthy, lordly “innocence” that was Greek. If he was anything in a
                word, Nietzsche was a Greek born two thousand<span class="pagenum" title="Page 13"> </span><a id="Page_13"></a> years too late. His
                dreams were thoroughly Hellenic; his whole manner of thinking was
                Hellenic; his peculiar errors were Hellenic no less. But his Hellenism,
                I need not add, was anything but the pale neo-Platonism that has run
                like a thread through the thinking of the Western world since the days
                of the Christian Fathers. From Plato, to be sure, he got what all of us
                must get, but his real forefather was Heraclitus. It is in Heraclitus
                that one finds the germ of his primary view of the universe—a view, to
                wit, that sees it, not as moral phenomenon, but as mere aesthetic
                representation. The God that Nietzsche imagined, in the end, was not far
                from the God that such an artist as Joseph Conrad imagines—a supreme
                craftsman, ever experimenting, ever coming closer to an ideal balancing
                of lines and forces, and yet always failing to work out the final
                harmony.</p>
                <p>The late war, awakening all the primitive racial fury of the Western
                nations, and therewith all their ancient enthusiasm for religious taboos
                and sanctions, naturally focused attention upon Nietzsche, as upon the
                most daring and provocative of recent amateur theologians. The Germans,
                with their characteristic tendency to ex<span class="pagenum" title="Page 14"> </span><a id="Page_14"></a>plain their every act in terms
                as realistic and unpleasant as possible, appear to have mauled him in a
                belated and unexpected embrace, to the horror, I daresay, of the Kaiser,
                and perhaps to the even greater horror of Nietzsche’s own ghost. The
                folks of Anglo-Saxondom, with their equally characteristic tendency to
                explain all their enterprises romantically, simultaneously set him up as
                the Antichrist he no doubt secretly longed to be. The result was a great
                deal of misrepresentation and misunderstanding of him. From the pulpits
                of the allied countries, and particularly from those of England and the
                United States, a horde of patriotic ecclesiastics denounced him in
                extravagant terms as the author of all the horrors of the time, and in
                the newspapers, until the Kaiser was elected sole bugaboo, he shared the
                honors of that office with von Hindenburg, the Crown Prince, Capt.
                Boy-Ed, von Bernstorff and von Tirpitz. Most of this denunciation, of
                course, was frankly idiotic—the naïve pishposh of suburban Methodists,
                notoriety-seeking college professors, almost illiterate editorial
                writers, and other such numskulls. In much of it, including not a few
                official hymns of hate, Nietzsche was gravely discovered to be the
                teacher of such<span class="pagenum" title="Page 15"> </span><a id="Page_15"></a> spokesmen of the extremest sort of German nationalism
                as von Bernhardi and von Treitschke—which was just as intelligent as
                making George Bernard Shaw the mentor of Lloyd-George. In other solemn
                pronunciamentoes he was credited with being philosophically responsible
                for various imaginary crimes of the enemy—the wholesale slaughter or
                mutilation of prisoners of war, the deliberate burning down of Red Cross
                hospitals, the utilization of the corpses of the slain for soap-making.
                I amused myself, in those gaudy days, by collecting newspaper clippings
                to this general effect, and later on I shall probably publish a digest
                of them, as a contribution to the study of war hysteria. The thing went
                to unbelievable lengths. On the strength of the fact that I had
                published a book on Nietzsche in 1906, six years after his death, I was
                called upon by agents of the Department of Justice, elaborately
                outfitted with badges, to meet the charge that I was an intimate
                associate and agent of “the German monster, Nietzsky.” I quote the
                official <i>procès verbal</i>, an indignant but often misspelled document.
                Alas, poor Nietzsche! After all his laborious efforts to prove that he
                was not a German, but a Pole—even<span class="pagenum" title="Page 16"> </span><a id="Page_16"></a> after his heroic readiness, via
                anti-anti-Semitism, to meet the deduction that, if a Pole, then probably
                also a Jew!</p>
                <p>But under all this alarmed and preposterous tosh there was at least a
                sound instinct, and that was the instinct which recognized Nietzsche as
                the most eloquent, pertinacious and effective of all the critics of the
                philosophy to which the Allies against Germany stood committed, and on
                the strength of which, at all events in theory, the United States had
                engaged itself in the war. He was not, in point of fact, involved with
                the visible enemy, save in remote and transient ways; the German,
                officially, remained the most ardent of Christians during the war and
                became a democrat at its close. But he was plainly a foe of democracy in
                all its forms, political, religious and epistemological, and what is
                worse, his opposition was set forth in terms that were not only
                extraordinarily penetrating and devastating, but also uncommonly
                offensive. It was thus quite natural that he should have aroused a
                degree of indignation verging upon the pathological in the two countries
                that had planted themselves upon the democratic platform most boldly,
                and that felt it most shaky, one may add, under their feet.<span class="pagenum" title="Page 17"> </span><a id="Page_17"></a> I daresay
                that Nietzsche, had he been alive, would have got a lot of satisfaction
                out of the execration thus heaped upon him, not only because, being a
                vain fellow, he enjoyed execration as a tribute to his general
                singularity, and hence to his superiority, but also and more importantly
                because, being no mean psychologist, he would have recognized the
                disconcerting doubts underlying it. If Nietzsche’s criticism of
                democracy were as ignorant and empty, say, as the average evangelical
                clergyman’s criticism of Darwin’s hypothesis of natural selection, then
                the advocates of democracy could afford to dismiss it as loftily as the
                Darwinians dismiss the blather of the holy clerks. And if his attack
                upon Christianity were mere sound and fury, signifying nothing, then
                there would be no call for anathemas from the sacred desk. But these
                onslaughts, in point of fact, have behind them a tremendous learning and
                a great deal of point and plausibility—there are, in brief, bullets in
                the gun, teeth in the tiger,—and so it is no wonder that they excite
                the ire of men who hold, as a primary article of belief, that their
                acceptance would destroy civilization, darken the sun, and bring Jahveh
                to sobs upon His Throne.</p>
                <p><span class="pagenum" title="Page 18"> </span><a id="Page_18"></a>But in all this justifiable fear, of course, there remains a false
                assumption, and that is the assumption that Nietzsche proposed to
                destroy Christianity altogether, and so rob the plain people of the
                world of their virtue, their spiritual consolations, and their hope of
                heaven. Nothing could be more untrue. The fact is that Nietzsche had no
                interest whatever in the delusions of the plain people—that is,
                intrinsically. It seemed to him of small moment <i>what</i> they believed, so
                long as it was safely imbecile. What he stood against was not their
                beliefs, but the elevation of those beliefs, by any sort of democratic
                process, to the dignity of a state philosophy—what he feared most was
                the pollution and crippling of the superior minority by intellectual
                disease from below. His plain aim in “The Antichrist” was to combat that
                menace by completing the work begun, on the one hand, by Darwin and the
                other evolutionist philosophers, and, on the other hand, by German
                historians and philologians. The net effect of this earlier attack, in
                the eighties, had been the collapse of Christian theology as a serious
                concern of educated men. The mob, it must be obvious, was very little
                shaken; even to this day it has not put<span class="pagenum" title="Page 19"> </span><a id="Page_19"></a> off its belief in the essential
                Christian doctrines. But the <i>intelligentsia</i>, by 1885, had been pretty
                well convinced. No man of sound information, at the time Nietzsche
                planned “The Antichrist,” actually believed that the world was created
                in seven days, or that its fauna was once overwhelmed by a flood as a
                penalty for the sins of man, or that Noah saved the boa constrictor, the
                prairie dog and the <i>pediculus capitis</i> by taking a pair of each into
                the ark, or that Lot’s wife was turned into a pillar of salt, or that a
                fragment of the True Cross could cure hydrophobia. Such notions, still
                almost universally prevalent in Christendom a century before, were now
                confined to the great body of ignorant and credulous men—that is, to
                ninety-five or ninety-six percent. of the race. For a man of the
                superior minority to subscribe to one of them publicly was already
                sufficient to set him off as one in imminent need of psychiatrical
                attention. Belief in them had become a mark of inferiority, like the
                allied belief in madstones, magic and apparitions.</p>
                <p>But though the theology of Christianity had thus sunk to the lowly
                estate of a mere delusion of the rabble, propagated on that level by the
                ancient caste of sacerdotal parasites, the ethics<span class="pagenum" title="Page 20"> </span><a id="Page_20"></a> of Christianity
                continued to enjoy the utmost acceptance, and perhaps even more
                acceptance than ever before. It seemed to be generally felt, in fact,
                that they simply <i>must</i> be saved from the wreck—that the world would
                vanish into chaos if they went the way of the revelations supporting
                them. In this fear a great many judicious men joined, and so there arose
                what was, in essence, an absolutely new Christian cult—a cult, to wit,
                purged of all the supernaturalism superimposed upon the older cult by
                generations of theologians, and harking back to what was conceived to be
                the pure ethical doctrine of Jesus. This cult still flourishes;
                Protestantism tends to become identical with it; it invades Catholicism
                as Modernism; it is supported by great numbers of men whose intelligence
                is manifest and whose sincerity is not open to question. Even Nietzsche
                himself yielded to it in weak moments, as you will discover on examining
                his somewhat laborious effort to make Paul the villain of Christian
                theology, and Jesus no more than an innocent bystander. But this
                sentimental yielding never went far enough to distract his attention for
                long from his main idea, which was this: that Christian ethics were
                quite as dubious, at bot<span class="pagenum" title="Page 21"> </span><a id="Page_21"></a>tom, as Christian theology—that they were
                founded, just as surely as such childish fables as the story of Jonah
                and the whale, upon the peculiar prejudices and credulities, the special
                desires and appetites, of inferior men—that they warred upon the best
                interests of men of a better sort quite as unmistakably as the most
                extravagant of objective superstitions. In brief, what he saw in
                Christian ethics, under all the poetry and all the fine show of altruism
                and all the theoretical benefits therein, was a democratic effort to
                curb the egoism of the strong—a conspiracy of the <i>chandala</i> against
                the free functioning of their superiors, nay, against the free progress
                of mankind. This theory is the thing he exposes in “The Antichrist,”
                bringing to the business his amazingly chromatic and exigent eloquence
                at its finest flower. This is the “conspiracy” he sets forth in all the
                panoply of his characteristic italics, dashes, <i>sforzando</i> interjections
                and exclamation points.</p>
                <p>Well, an idea is an idea. The present one may be right and it may be
                wrong. One thing is quite certain: that no progress will be made against
                it by denouncing it as merely immoral. If it is ever laid at all, it
                must be laid evidenti<span class="pagenum" title="Page 22"> </span><a id="Page_22"></a>ally, logically. The notion to the contrary is
                thoroughly democratic; the mob is the most ruthless of tyrants; it is
                always in a democratic society that heresy and felony tend to be most
                constantly confused. One hears without surprise of a Bismarck
                philosophizing placidly (at least in his old age) upon the delusion of
                Socialism and of a Frederick the Great playing the hose of his cynicism
                upon the absolutism that was almost identical with his own person, but
                men in the mass never brook the destructive discussion of their
                fundamental beliefs, and that impatience is naturally most evident in
                those societies in which men in the mass are most influential. Democracy
                and free speech are not facets of one gem; democracy and free speech are
                eternal enemies. But in any battle between an institution and an idea,
                the idea, in the long run, has the better of it. Here I do not venture
                into the absurdity of arguing that, as the world wags on, the truth
                always survives. I believe nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact, it
                seems to me that an idea that happens to be true—or, more exactly, as
                near to truth as any human idea can be, and yet remain generally
                intelligible—it seems to me that such an idea carries a special and
                often fatal handi<span class="pagenum" title="Page 23"> </span><a id="Page_23"></a>cap. The majority of men prefer delusion to truth. It
                soothes. It is easy to grasp. Above all, it fits more snugly than the
                truth into a universe of false appearances—of complex and irrational
                phenomena, defectively grasped. But though an idea that is true is thus
                not likely to prevail, an idea that is <i>attacked</i> enjoys a great
                advantage. The evidence behind it is now supported by sympathy, the
                sporting instinct, sentimentality—and sentimentality is as powerful as
                an army with banners. One never hears of a martyr in history whose
                notions are seriously disputed today. The forgotten ideas are those of
                the men who put them forward soberly and quietly, hoping fatuously that
                they would conquer by the force of their truth; these are the ideas that
                we now struggle to rediscover. Had Nietzsche lived to be burned at the
                stake by outraged Mississippi Methodists, it would have been a glorious
                day for his doctrines. As it is, they are helped on their way every time
                they are denounced as immoral and against God. The war brought down upon
                them the maledictions of vast herds of right-thinking men. And now “The
                Antichrist,” after fifteen years of neglect, is being reprinted....</p>
                <p><span class="pagenum" title="Page 24"> </span><a id="Page_24"></a>One imagines the author, a sardonic wraith, snickering somewhat sadly
                over the fact. His shade, wherever it suffers, is favoured in these days
                by many such consolations, some of them of much greater horsepower.
                Think of the facts and arguments, even the underlying theories and
                attitudes, that have been borrowed from him, consciously and
                unconsciously, by the foes of Bolshevism during these last thrilling
                years! The face of democracy, suddenly seen hideously close, has scared
                the guardians of the reigning plutocracy half to death, and they have
                gone to the devil himself for aid. Southern Senators, almost illiterate
                men, have mixed his acids with well water and spouted them like
                affrighted geysers, not knowing what they did. Nor are they the first to
                borrow from him. Years ago I called attention to the debt incurred with
                characteristic forgetfulness of obligation by the late Theodore
                Roosevelt, in “The Strenuous Life” and elsewhere. Roosevelt, a typical
                apologist for the existing order, adeptly dragging a herring across the
                trail whenever it was menaced, yet managed to delude the native boobery,
                at least until toward the end, into accepting him as a fiery exponent of
                pure democ<span class="pagenum" title="Page 25"> </span><a id="Page_25"></a>racy. Perhaps he even fooled himself; charlatans usually do
                so soon or late. A study of Nietzsche reveals the sources of much that
                was honest in him, and exposes the hollowness of much that was sham.
                Nietzsche, an infinitely harder and more courageous intellect, was
                incapable of any such confusion of ideas; he seldom allowed
                sentimentality to turn him from the glaring fact. What is called
                Bolshevism today he saw clearly a generation ago and described for what
                it was and is—democracy in another aspect, the old
                <i><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original read ‘resssentiment.’">ressentiment</ins></i> of the lower orders in free function
                once more. Socialism, Puritanism, Philistinism, Christianity—he saw
                them all as allotropic forms of democracy, as variations upon the
                endless struggle of quantity against quality, of the weak and timorous
                against the strong and enterprising, of the botched against the fit. The
                world needed a staggering exaggeration to make it see even half of the
                truth. It trembles today as it trembled during the French Revolution.
                Perhaps it would tremble less if it could combat the monster with a
                clearer conscience and less burden of compromising theory—if it could
                launch its forces frankly at the fundamental doctrine, and<span class="pagenum" title="Page 26"> </span><a id="Page_26"></a> not merely
                employ them to police the transient orgy.</p>
                <p>Nietzsche, in the long run, may help it toward that greater honesty. His
                notions, propagated by cuttings from cuttings from cuttings, may
                conceivably prepare the way for a sounder, more healthful theory of
                society and of the state, and so free human progress from the
                stupidities which now hamper it, and men of true vision from the
                despairs which now sicken them. I say it is conceivable, but I doubt
                that it is probable. The soul and the belly of mankind are too evenly
                balanced; it is not likely that the belly will ever put away its hunger
                or forget its power. Here, perhaps, there is an example of the eternal
                recurrence that Nietzsche was fond of mulling over in his blacker moods.
                We are in the midst of one of the perennial risings of the lower orders.
                It got under way long before any of the current Bolshevist demons was
                born; it was given its long, secure start by the intolerable tyranny of
                the plutocracy—the end product of the Eighteenth Century revolt against
                the old aristocracy. It found resistance suddenly slackened by civil war
                within the plutocracy itself—one gang of traders falling upon another
                gang, to the tune of<span class="pagenum" title="Page 27"> </span><a id="Page_27"></a> vast hymn-singing and yells to God. Perhaps it has
                already passed its apogee; the plutocracy, chastened, shows signs of a
                new solidarity; the wheel continues to swing ’round. But this combat
                between proletariat and plutocracy is, after all, itself a civil war.
                Two inferiorities struggle for the privilege of polluting the world.
                What actual difference does it make to a civilized man, when there is a
                steel strike, whether the workmen win or the mill-owners win? The
                conflict can interest him only as spectacle, as the conflict between
                Bonaparte and the old order in Europe interested Goethe and Beethoven.
                The victory, whichever way it goes, will simply bring chaos nearer, and
                so set the stage for a genuine revolution later on, with (let us hope) a
                new feudalism or something better coming out of it, and a new Thirteenth
                Century at dawn. This seems to be the slow, costly way of the worst of
                habitable worlds.</p>
                <p>In the present case my money is laid upon the plutocracy. It will win
                because it will be able, in the long run, to enlist the finer
                intelligences. The mob and its maudlin causes attract only
                sentimentalists and scoundrels, chiefly the latter. Politics, under a
                democracy, reduces<span class="pagenum" title="Page 28"> </span><a id="Page_28"></a> itself to a mere struggle for office by flatterers
                of the proletariat; even when a superior man prevails at that disgusting
                game he must prevail at the cost of his self-respect. Not many superior
                men make the attempt. The average great captain of the rabble, when he
                is not simply a weeper over irremediable wrongs, is a hypocrite so far
                gone that he is unconscious of his own hypocrisy—a slimy fellow,
                offensive to the nose. The plutocracy can recruit measurably more
                respectable janissaries, if only because it can make self-interest less
                obviously costly to <i>amour propre</i>. Its defect and its weakness lie in
                the fact that it is still too young to have acquired dignity. But lately
                sprung from the mob it now preys upon, it yet shows some of the habits
                of mind of that mob: it is blatant, stupid, ignorant, lacking in all
                delicate instinct and governmental finesse. Above all, it remains
                somewhat heavily moral. One seldom finds it undertaking one of its
                characteristic imbecilities without offering a sonorous moral reason; it
                spends almost as much to support the Y. M. C. A., vice-crusading,
                Prohibition and other such puerilities as it spends upon Congressmen,
                strike-breakers, gun-men, kept patriots and newspapers. In Eng<span class="pagenum" title="Page 29"> </span><a id="Page_29"></a>land the
                case is even worse. It is almost impossible to find a wealthy industrial
                over there who is not also an eminent non-conformist layman, and even
                among financiers there are praying brothers. On the Continent, the day
                is saved by the fact that the plutocracy tends to become more and more
                Jewish. Here the intellectual cynicism of the Jew almost counterbalances
                his social unpleasantness. If he is destined to lead the plutocracy of
                the world out of Little Bethel he will fail, of course, to turn it into
                an aristocracy—<i>i. e.</i>, a caste of gentlemen—, but he will at least
                make it clever, and hence worthy of consideration. The case against the
                Jews is long and damning; it would justify ten thousand times as many
                pogroms as now go on in the world. But whenever you find a
                Davidsbündlerschaft making practise against the Philistines, there you
                will find a Jew laying on. Maybe it was this fact that caused Nietzsche
                to speak up for the children of Israel quite as often as he spoke
                against them. He was not blind to their faults, but when he set them
                beside Christians he could not deny their general superiority. Perhaps
                in America and England, as on the Continent, the increasing Jewishness
                of the plutocracy, while<span class="pagenum" title="Page 30"> </span><a id="Page_30"></a> cutting it off from all chance of ever
                developing into an aristocracy, will yet lift it to such a dignity that
                it will at least deserve a certain grudging respect.</p>
                <p>But even so, it will remain in a sort of half-world, midway between the
                gutter and the stars. Above it will still stand the small group of men
                that constitutes the permanent aristocracy of the race—the men of
                imagination and high purpose, the makers of genuine progress, the brave
                and ardent spirits, above all petty fears and discontents and above all
                petty hopes and ideals no less. There were heroes before Agamemnon;
                there will be Bachs after Johann Sebastian. And beneath the Judaized
                plutocracy, the sublimated <i>bourgeoisie</i>, there the immemorial
                proletariat, I venture to guess, will roar on, endlessly tortured by its
                vain hatreds and envies, stampeded and made to tremble by its ancient
                superstitions, prodded and made miserable by its sordid and degrading
                hopes. It seems to me very likely that, in this proletariat,
                Christianity will continue to survive. It is nonsense, true enough, but
                it is sweet. Nietzsche, denouncing its dangers as a poison, almost falls
                into the error of denying it its undoubtedly sugary smack. Of<span class="pagenum" title="Page 31"> </span><a id="Page_31"></a> all the
                religions ever devised by the great practical jokers of the race, this
                is the one that offers most for the least money, so to speak, to the
                inferior man. It starts out by denying his inferiority in plain terms:
                <i>all</i> men are equal in the sight of God. It ends by erecting that
                inferiority into a sort of actual superiority: it is a merit to be
                stupid, and miserable, and sorely put upon—of such are the celestial
                elect. Not all the eloquence of a million Nietzsches, nor all the
                painful marshalling of evidence of a million Darwins and Harnacks, will
                ever empty that great consolation of its allure. The most they can ever
                accomplish is to make the superior orders of men acutely conscious of
                the exact nature of it, and so give them armament against the contagion.
                This is going on; this is being done. I think that “The Antichrist” has
                a useful place in that enterprise. It is strident, it is often
                extravagant, it is, to many sensitive men, in the worst of possible
                taste, but at bottom it is enormously apt and effective—and on the
                surface it is undoubtedly a good show. One somehow enjoys, with the
                malice that is native to man, the spectacle of anathemas batted back; it
                is refreshing to see the pitchfork employed against gentlemen who have<span class="pagenum" title="Page 32"> </span><a id="Page_32"></a>
                doomed such innumerable caravans to hell. In Nietzsche they found, after
                many long years, a foeman worthy of them—not a mere fancy swordsman
                like Voltaire, or a mob orator like Tom Paine, or a pedant like the
                heretics of exegesis, but a gladiator armed with steel and armoured with
                steel, and showing all the ferocious gusto of a mediaeval bishop. It is
                a pity that Holy Church has no process for the elevation of demons, like
                its process for the canonization of saints. There must be a long roll of
                black miracles to the discredit of the Accursed Friedrich—sinners
                purged of conscience and made happy in their sinning, clerics shaken in
                their theology by visions of a new and better holy city, the strong made
                to exult, the weak robbed of their old sad romance. It would be a
                pleasure to see the <i>Advocatus Diaboli</i> turn from the table of the
                prosecution to the table of the defence, and move in solemn form for the
                damnation of the Naumburg hobgoblin....</p>
                <p>Of all Nietzsche’s books, “The Antichrist” comes nearest to
                conventionality in form. It presents a connected argument with very few
                interludes, and has a beginning, a middle and an end. Most of his works
                are in the form of col<span class="pagenum" title="Page 33"> </span><a id="Page_33"></a>lections of apothegms, and sometimes the subject
                changes on every second page. This fact constitutes one of the counts in
                the orthodox indictment of him: it is cited as proof that his capacity
                for consecutive thought was limited, and that he was thus deficient
                mentally, and perhaps a downright moron. The argument, it must be
                obvious, is fundamentally nonsensical. What deceives the professors is
                the traditional prolixity of philosophers. Because the average
                philosophical writer, when he essays to expose his ideas, makes such
                inordinate drafts upon the parts of speech that the dictionary is almost
                emptied these defective observers jump to the conclusion that his
                intrinsic notions are of corresponding weight. This is not unseldom
                quite untrue. What makes philosophy so garrulous is not the profundity
                of philosophers, but their lack of art; they are like physicians who
                sought to cure a slight hyperacidity by giving the patient a carload of
                burned oyster-shells to eat. There is, too, the endless poll-parrotting
                that goes on: each new philosopher must prove his learning by
                laboriously rehearsing the ideas of all previous philosophers....
                Nietzsche avoided both faults. He always assumed that his readers<span class="pagenum" title="Page 34"> </span><a id="Page_34"></a> knew
                the books, and that it was thus unnecessary to rewrite them. And, having
                an idea that seemed to him to be novel and original, he stated it in as
                few words as possible, and then shut down. Sometimes he got it into a
                hundred words; sometimes it took a thousand; now and then, as in the
                present case, he developed a series of related ideas into a connected
                book. But he never wrote a word too many. He never pumped up an idea to
                make it appear bigger than it actually was. The pedagogues, alas, are
                not accustomed to that sort of writing in serious fields. They resent
                it, and sometimes they even try to improve it. There exists, in fact, a
                huge and solemn tome on Nietzsche by a learned man of America in which
                all of his brilliancy is painfully translated into the windy phrases of
                the seminaries. The tome is satisfactorily ponderous, but the meat of
                the cocoanut is left out: there is actually no discussion of the
                Nietzschean view of Christianity!... Always Nietzsche daunts the
                pedants. He employed too few words for them—and he had too many ideas.</p>
                <hr class="minor">
                <p>The present translation of “The Antichrist” is published by agreement
                with Dr. Oscar Levy,<span class="pagenum" title="Page 35"> </span><a id="Page_35"></a> editor of the English edition of Nietzsche. There
                are two earlier translations, one by Thomas Common and the other by
                Anthony M. Ludovici. That of Mr. Common follows the text very closely,
                and thus occasionally shows some essentially German turns of phrase;
                that of Mr. Ludovici is more fluent but rather less exact. I do not
                offer my own version on the plea that either of these is useless; on the
                contrary, I cheerfully acknowledge that they have much merit, and that
                they helped me at almost every line. I began this new Englishing of the
                book, not in any hope of supplanting them, and surely not with any
                notion of meeting a great public need, but simply as a private amusement
                in troubled days. But as I got on with it I began to see ways of putting
                some flavour of Nietzsche’s peculiar style into the English, and so
                amusement turned into a more or less serious labour. The result, of
                course, is far from satisfactory, but it at least represents a very
                diligent attempt. Nietzsche, always under the influence of French
                models, wrote a German that differs materially from any other German
                that I know. It is more nervous, more varied, more rapid in tempo; it
                runs to more effective climaxes; it is never<span class="pagenum" title="Page 36"> </span><a id="Page_36"></a> stodgy. His marks begin to
                show upon the writing of the younger Germans of today. They are getting
                away from the old thunderous manner, with its long sentences and its
                tedious grammatical complexities. In the course of time, I daresay, they
                will develop a German almost as clear as French and almost as colourful
                and resilient as English.</p>
                <p>I owe thanks to Dr. Levy for his <i>imprimatur</i>, to Mr. Theodor Hemberger
                for criticism, and to Messrs. Common and Ludovici for showing me the way

                seriousness, my passion, he must carry intellectual integrity to the
                verge of hardness. He must be accustomed to living on mountain tops—and
                to looking upon the wretched gabble of politics and nationalism as
                <i>beneath</i> him. He must have become indifferent; he must never ask of the
                truth whether it brings profit to him or a fatality to him.... He must
                have an inclination, born of strength, for questions that no one has the
                courage for; the courage for the <i>forbidden</i>; predestination for the

                <h3>1.</h3>
                <p>—Let us look each other in the face. We are Hyperboreans—we know well
                enough how remote our place is. “Neither by land nor by water will you
                find the road to the Hyperboreans”: even Pindar,<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a> in his day, knew
                <i>that</i> much about us. Beyond the North, beyond the ice, beyond
                <i>death</i>—<i>our</i> life, <i>our</i> happiness.... We have discovered that
                happiness; we know the way; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of
                years in the labyrinth. Who <i>else</i> has found it?—The man of today?—“I
                don’t know either the way out or the way in; I am whatever doesn’t know
                either the way out or the way in”—so sighs the man of today.... <i>This</i>
                is the sort of modernity that made us ill,—we sickened on lazy peace,
                cowardly compro<span class="pagenum" title="Page 42"> </span><a id="Page_42"></a>mise, the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern Yea and
                Nay. This tolerance and <i>largeur</i> of the heart that “forgives”
                everything because it “understands” everything is a sirocco to us.
                Rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such
                south-winds!... We were brave enough; we spared neither ourselves nor
                others; but we were a long time finding out <i>where</i> to direct our
                courage. We grew dismal; they called us fatalists. <i>Our</i> fate—it was
                the fulness, the tension, the <i>storing up</i> of powers. We thirsted for
                the lightnings and great deeds; we kept as far as possible from the
                happiness of the weakling, from “resignation”... There was thunder in
                our air; nature, as we embodied it, became overcast—<i>for we had not yet
                found the way</i>. The formula of our happiness: a Yea, a Nay, a straight
                line, a <i>goal</i>....</p>

                <h3>3.</h3>
                <p>The problem that I set here is not what shall replace mankind in the
                order of living creatures (—man is an end—): but what type of man must
                be <i>bred</i>, must be <i>willed</i>, as being the most valuable, the most worthy
                of life, the most secure guarantee of the future.</p>
                <p>This more valuable type has appeared often enough in the past: but
                always as a happy accident, as an exception, never as deliberately
                <i>willed</i>. Very often it has been precisely the most feared; hitherto it
                has been almost <i>the</i> terror of terrors;—and out of that terror the<span class="pagenum" title="Page 44"> </span><a id="Page_44"></a>
                contrary type has been willed, cultivated and <i>attained</i>: the domestic
                animal, the herd animal, the sick brute-man—the Christian....</p>
                <h3>4.</h3>
                <p>Mankind surely does <i>not</i> represent an evolution toward a better or
                stronger or higher level, as progress is now understood. This “progress”
                is merely a modern idea, which is to say, a false idea. The European of
                today, in his essential worth, falls far below the European of the
                Renaissance; the process of evolution does <i>not</i> necessarily mean
                elevation, enhancement, strengthening.</p>
                <p>True enough, it succeeds in isolated and individual cases in various
                parts of the earth and under the most widely different cultures, and in
                these cases a <i>higher</i> type certainly manifests itself; something which,
                compared to mankind in the mass, appears as a sort of superman. Such
                happy strokes of high success have always been possible, and will remain
                possible, perhaps, for all time to come. Even whole races, tribes and
                nations may occasionally represent such lucky accidents.</p>
                <h3><span class="pagenum" title="Page 45"> </span><a id="Page_45"></a>5.</h3>
                <p>We should not deck out and embellish Christianity: it has waged a war to
                the death against this <i>higher</i> type of man, it has put all the deepest
                instincts of this type under its ban, it has developed its concept of
                evil, of the Evil One himself, out of these instincts—the strong man as
                the typical reprobate, the “outcast among men.” Christianity has taken
                the part of all the weak, the low, the botched; it has made an ideal out
                of <i>antagonism</i> to all the self-preservative instincts of sound life; it
                has corrupted even the faculties of those natures that are
                intellectually most vigorous, by representing the highest intellectual
                values as sinful, as misleading, as full of temptation. The most
                lamentable example: the corruption of Pascal, who believed that his
                intellect had been destroyed by original sin, whereas it was actually
                destroyed by Christianity!—</p>
                <h3>6.</h3>
                <p>It is a painful and tragic spectacle that rises before me: I have drawn
                back the curtain from the <i>rottenness</i> of man. This word, in my mouth,<span class="pagenum" title="Page 46"> </span><a id="Page_46"></a>
                is at least free from one suspicion: that it involves a moral accusation
                against humanity. It is used—and I wish to emphasize the fact
                again—without any moral significance: and this is so far true that the
                rottenness I speak of is most apparent to me precisely in those quarters
                where there has been most aspiration, hitherto, toward “virtue” and
                “godliness.” As you probably surmise, I understand rottenness in the
                sense of <i>décadence</i>: my argument is that all the values on which
                mankind now fixes its highest aspirations are <i>décadence</i>-values.</p>
                <p>I call an animal, a species, an individual corrupt, when it loses its
                instincts, when it chooses, when it <i>prefers</i>, what is injurious to it.
                A history of the “higher feelings,” the “ideals of humanity”—and it is
                possible that I’ll have to write it—would almost explain why man is so
                degenerate. Life itself appears to me as an instinct for growth, for
                survival, for the accumulation of forces, for <i>power</i>: whenever the will
                to power fails there is disaster. My contention is that all the highest
                values of humanity have been emptied of this will—that the values of
                <i>décadence</i>, of <i>nihilism</i>, now prevail under the holiest names.</p>
                <h3><span class="pagenum" title="Page 47"> </span><a id="Page_47"></a>7.</h3>
                <p>Christianity is called the religion of <i>pity</i>.—Pity stands in
                opposition to all the tonic passions that augment the energy of the
                feeling of aliveness: it is a depressant. A man loses power when he
                pities. Through pity that drain upon strength which suffering works is
                multiplied a thousandfold. Suffering is made contagious by pity; under
                certain circumstances it may lead to a total sacrifice of life and
                living energy—a loss out of all proportion to the magnitude of the
                cause (—the case of the death of the Nazarene). This is the first view
                of it; there is, however, a still more important one. If one measures
                the effects of pity by the gravity of the reactions it sets up, its
                character as a menace to life appears in a much clearer light. Pity
                thwarts the whole law of evolution, which is the law of natural
                selection. It preserves whatever is ripe for destruction; it fights on
                the side of those disinherited and condemned by life; by maintaining
                life in so many of the botched of all kinds, it gives life itself a
                gloomy and dubious aspect. Mankind has ventured to call pity a virtue
                (—in every <i>superior</i> moral<span class="pagenum" title="Page 48"> </span><a id="Page_48"></a> system it appears as a weakness—); going
                still further, it has been called <i>the</i> virtue, the source and
                foundation of all other virtues—but let us always bear in mind that
                this was from the standpoint of a philosophy that was nihilistic, and
                upon whose shield <i>the denial of life</i> was inscribed. Schopenhauer was
                right in this: that by means of pity life is denied, and made <i>worthy of
                denial</i>—pity is the technic of nihilism. Let me repeat: this depressing
                and contagious instinct stands against all those instincts which work
                for the preservation and enhancement of life: in the rôle of <i>protector</i>
                of the miserable, it is a prime agent in the promotion of
                <i>décadence</i>—pity persuades to extinction.... Of course, one doesn’t say
                “extinction”: one says “the other world,” or “God,” or “the <i>true</i>
                life,” or Nirvana, salvation, blessedness.... This innocent rhetoric,
                from the realm of religious-ethical balderdash, appears <i>a good deal
                less innocent</i> when one reflects upon the tendency that it conceals
                beneath sublime words: the tendency to <i>destroy life</i>. Schopenhauer was
                hostile to life: that is why pity appeared to him as a virtue....
                Aristotle, as every one knows, saw in pity a sickly and dangerous<span class="pagenum" title="Page 49"> </span><a id="Page_49"></a> state
                of mind, the remedy for which was an occasional purgative: he regarded
                tragedy as that purgative. The instinct of life should prompt us to seek
                some means of puncturing any such pathological and dangerous
                accumulation of pity as that appearing in Schopenhauer’s case (and also,
                alack, in that of our whole literary <i>décadence</i>, from St. Petersburg to
                Paris, from Tolstoi to Wagner), that it may burst and be discharged....
                Nothing is more unhealthy, amid all our unhealthy modernism, than
                Christian pity. To be the doctors <i>here</i>, to be unmerciful <i>here</i>, to
                wield the knife <i>here</i>—all this is <i>our</i> business, all this is <i>our</i>
                sort of humanity, by this sign we are philosophers, we Hyperboreans!—</p>
                <h3>8.</h3>
                <p>It is necessary to say just <i>whom</i> we regard as our antagonists:
                theologians and all who have any theological blood in their veins—this
                is our whole philosophy.... One must have faced that menace at close
                hand, better still, one must have had experience of it directly and
                almost succumbed to it, to realize that it is not to be taken lightly
                (—the alleged free-thinking of our<span class="pagenum" title="Page 50"> </span><a id="Page_50"></a> naturalists and physiologists seems
                to me to be a joke—they have no passion about such things; they have
                not suffered—). This poisoning goes a great deal further than most
                people think: I find the arrogant habit of the theologian among all who
                regard themselves as “idealists”—among all who, by virtue of a higher
                point of departure, claim a right to rise above reality, and to look
                upon it with suspicion.... The idealist, like the ecclesiastic, carries
                all sorts of lofty concepts in his hand (—and not only in his hand!);
                he launches them with benevolent contempt against “understanding,” “the
                senses,” “honor,” “good living,” “science”; he sees such things as
                <i>beneath</i> him, as pernicious and seductive forces, on which “the soul”
                soars as a pure thing-in-itself—as if humility, chastity, poverty, in a
                word, <i>holiness</i>, had not already done much more damage to life than all
                imaginable horrors and vices.... The pure soul is a pure lie.... So long
                as the priest, that <i>professional</i> denier, calumniator and poisoner of
                life, is accepted as a <i>higher</i> variety of man, there can be no answer
                to the question, What <i>is</i> truth? Truth has already been stood on its
                head when the obvious attorney of<span class="pagenum" title="Page 51"> </span><a id="Page_51"></a> mere emptiness is mistaken for its
                representative....</p>
                <h3>9.</h3>
                <p>Upon this theological instinct I make war: I find the tracks of it
                everywhere. Whoever has theological blood in his veins is shifty and
                dishonourable in all things. The pathetic thing that grows out of this
                condition is called <i>faith</i>: in other words, closing one’s eyes upon
                one’s self once for all, to avoid suffering the sight of incurable
                falsehood. People erect a concept of morality, of virtue, of holiness
                upon this false view of all things; they ground good conscience upon
                faulty vision; they argue that no <i>other</i> sort of vision has value any
                more, once they have made theirs sacrosanct with the names of “God,”
                “salvation” and “eternity.” I unearth this theological instinct in all
                directions: it is the most widespread and the most <i>subterranean</i> form
                of falsehood to be found on earth. Whatever a theologian regards as true
                <i>must</i> be false: there you have almost a criterion of truth. His
                profound instinct of self-preservation stands against truth ever coming
                into honour in any way, or even getting stated. Wherever the in<span class="pagenum" title="Page 52"> </span><a id="Page_52"></a>fluence
                of theologians is felt there is a transvaluation of values, and the
                concepts “true” and “false” are forced to change places: whatever is
                most damaging to life is there called “true,” and whatever exalts it,
                intensifies it, approves it, justifies it and makes it triumphant is
                there called “false.”... When theologians, working through the
                “consciences” of princes (or of peoples—), stretch out their hands for
                <i>power</i>, there is never any doubt as to the fundamental issue: the will
                to make an end, the <i>nihilistic</i> will exerts that power....</p>
                <h3>10.</h3>
                <p>Among Germans I am immediately understood when I say that theological
                blood is the ruin of philosophy. The Protestant pastor is the
                grandfather of German philosophy; Protestantism itself is its <i>peccatum
                originale</i>. Definition of Protestantism: hemiplegic paralysis of
                Christianity—<i>and</i> of reason.... One need only utter the words
                “Tübingen School” to get an understanding of what German philosophy is
                at bottom—a very artful form of theology.... The Suabians are the best
                liars in Germany; they lie innocently.... Why all<span class="pagenum" title="Page 53"> </span><a id="Page_53"></a> the rejoicing over
                the appearance of Kant that went through the learned world of Germany,
                three-fourths of which is made up of the sons of preachers and
                teachers—why the German conviction still echoing, that with Kant came a
                change for the <i>better</i>? The theological instinct of German scholars
                made them see clearly just <i>what</i> had become possible again.... A
                backstairs leading to the old ideal stood open; the concept of the “true
                world,” the concept of morality as the <i>essence</i> of the world (—the two
                most vicious errors that ever existed!), were once more, thanks to a
                subtle and wily scepticism, if not actually demonstrable, then <i>at
                least</i> no longer <i>refutable</i>.... <i>Reason</i>, the <i>prerogative</i> of reason,
                does not go so far.... Out of reality there had been made “appearance”;
                an absolutely false world, that of being, had been turned into
                reality.... The success of Kant is merely a theological success; he was,
                like Luther and Leibnitz, but one more impediment to German integrity,
                already far from steady.—</p>
                <h3>11.</h3>
                <p>A word now against Kant as a moralist. A virtue must be <i>our</i> invention;
                it must spring out<span class="pagenum" title="Page 54"> </span><a id="Page_54"></a> of <i>our</i> personal need and defence. In every other
                case it is a source of danger. That which does not belong to our life
                <i>menaces</i> it; a virtue which has its roots in mere respect for the
                concept of “virtue,” as Kant would have it, is pernicious. “Virtue,”
                “duty,” “good for its own sake,” goodness grounded upon impersonality or
                a notion of universal validity—these are all chimeras, and in them one
                finds only an expression of the decay, the last collapse of life, the
                Chinese spirit of Königsberg. Quite the contrary is demanded by the most
                profound laws of self-preservation and of growth: to wit, that every man
                find his <i>own</i> virtue, his <i>own</i> categorical imperative. A nation goes
                to pieces when it confounds <i>its</i> duty with the general concept of duty.
                Nothing works a more complete and penetrating disaster than every
                “impersonal” duty, every sacrifice before the Moloch of abstraction.—To
                think that no one has thought of Kant’s categorical imperative as
                <i>dangerous to life</i>!... The theological instinct alone took it under
                protection!—An action prompted by the life-instinct proves that it is a
                <i>right</i> action by the amount of pleasure that goes with it: and yet that
                Nihilist, with his bowels<span class="pagenum" title="Page 55"> </span><a id="Page_55"></a> of Christian dogmatism, regarded pleasure as
                an <i>objection</i>.... What destroys a man more quickly than to work, think
                and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire,
                without pleasure—as a mere automaton of duty? That is the recipe for
                <i>décadence</i>, and no less for idiocy.... Kant became an idiot.—And such
                a man was the contemporary of Goethe! This calamitous spinner of cobwebs
                passed for <i>the</i> German philosopher—still passes today!... I forbid
                myself to say what I think of the Germans.... Didn’t Kant see in the
                French Revolution the transformation of the state from the inorganic
                form to the <i>organic</i>? Didn’t he ask himself if there was a single event
                that could be explained save on the assumption of a moral faculty in
                man, so that on the basis of it, “the tendency of mankind toward the
                good” could be <i>explained</i>, once and for all time? Kant’s answer: “That
                is revolution.” Instinct at fault in everything and anything, instinct
                as a revolt against nature, German <i>décadence</i> as a philosophy—<i>that is
                Kant</i>!<span class="pagenum" title="Page 56"> </span><a id="Page_56"></a>—</p>
                <h3>12.</h3>
                <p>I put aside a few sceptics, the types of decency in the history of
                philosophy: the rest haven’t the slightest conception of intellectual
                integrity. They behave like women, all these great enthusiasts and
                prodigies—they regard “beautiful feelings” as arguments, the “heaving
                breast” as the bellows of divine inspiration, conviction as the
                <i>criterion</i> of truth. In the end, with “German” innocence, Kant tried to
                give a scientific flavour to this form of corruption, this dearth of
                intellectual conscience, by calling it “practical reason.” He
                deliberately invented a variety of reasons for use on occasions when it
                was desirable not to trouble with reason—that is, when morality, when
                the sublime command “thou shalt,” was heard. When one recalls the fact
                that, among all peoples, the philosopher is no more than a development
                from the old type of priest, this inheritance from the priest, this
                <i>fraud upon self</i>, ceases to be remarkable. When a man feels that he has
                a divine mission, say to lift up, to save or to liberate mankind—when a
                man feels the divine spark in his heart and believes that he is the
                mouthpiece of super<span class="pagenum" title="Page 57"> </span><a id="Page_57"></a>natural imperatives—when such a mission inflames
                him, it is only natural that he should stand beyond all merely
                reasonable standards of judgment. He feels that he is <i>himself</i>
                sanctified by this mission, that he is himself a type of a higher
                order!... What has a priest to do with philosophy! He stands far above
                it!—And hitherto the priest has <i>ruled</i>!—He has determined the meaning
                of “true” and “not true”!...</p>
                <h3>13.</h3>
                <p>Let us not <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original read ‘under-estimate.’">underestimate</ins> this fact: that <i>we
                ourselves</i>, we free spirits, are already a “transvaluation of all
                values,” a <i>visualized</i> declaration of war and victory against all the
                old concepts of “true” and “not true.” The most valuable intuitions are
                the last to be attained; the most valuable of all are those which
                determine <i>methods</i>. All the methods, all the principles of the
                scientific spirit of today, were the targets for thousands of years of
                the most profound contempt; if a man inclined to them he was excluded
                from the society of “decent” people—he passed as “an enemy of God,” as
                a scoffer at the truth, as one “possessed.” As<span class="pagenum" title="Page 58"> </span><a id="Page_58"></a> a man of science, he
                belonged to the Chandala<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a>.... We have had the whole pathetic stupidity
                of mankind against us—their every notion of what the truth <i>ought</i> to
                be, of what the service of the truth <i>ought</i> to be—their every “thou
                shalt” was launched against us.... Our objectives, our methods, our
                quiet, cautious, distrustful manner—all appeared to them as absolutely
                discreditable and contemptible.—Looking back, one may almost ask one’s
                self with reason if it was not actually an <i>aesthetic</i> sense that kept
                men blind so long: what they demanded of the truth was picturesque
                effectiveness, and of the learned a strong appeal to their senses. It
                was our <i>modesty</i> that stood out longest against their taste.... How
                well they guessed that, these turkey-cocks of God!</p>
                <div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_2_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_2" class="pginternal">[2]</a></span> The lowest of the Hindu castes.</p></div>
                <h3>14.</h3>
                <p>We have unlearned something. We have become more modest in every way. We
                no longer derive man from the “spirit,” from the “godhead”; we have
                dropped him back among the beasts. We regard him as the strongest of the
                beasts because he is the craftiest; one of the re<span class="pagenum" title="Page 59"> </span><a id="Page_59"></a>sults thereof is his
                intellectuality. On the other hand, we guard ourselves against a conceit
                which would assert itself even here: that man is the great second
                thought in the process of organic evolution. He is, in truth, anything
                but the crown of creation: beside him stand many other animals, all at
                similar stages of development.... And even when we say that we say a bit
                too much, for man, relatively speaking, is the most botched of all the
                animals and the sickliest, and he has wandered the most dangerously from
                his instincts—though for all that, to be sure, he remains the most
                <i>interesting</i>!—As regards the lower animals, it was Descartes who first
                had the really admirable daring to describe them as <i>machina</i>; the whole
                of our physiology is directed toward proving the truth of this doctrine.
                Moreover, it is illogical to set man apart, as Descartes did: what we
                know of man today is limited precisely by the extent to which we have
                regarded him, too, as a machine. Formerly we accorded to man, as his
                inheritance from some higher order of beings, what was called “free
                will”; now we have taken even this will from him, for the term no longer
                describes anything that we can understand. The old word<span class="pagenum" title="Page 60"> </span><a id="Page_60"></a> “will” now
                connotes only a sort of result, an individual reaction, that follows
                inevitably upon a series of partly discordant and partly harmonious
                stimuli—the will no longer “acts,” or “moves.”... Formerly it was
                thought that man’s consciousness, his “spirit,” offered evidence of his
                high origin, his divinity. That he might be <i>perfected</i>, he was advised,
                tortoise-like, to draw his senses in, to have no traffic with earthly
                things, to shuffle off his mortal coil—then only the important part of
                him, the “pure spirit,” would remain. Here again we have thought out the
                thing better: to us consciousness, or “the spirit,” appears as a symptom
                of a relative imperfection of the organism, as an experiment, a groping,
                a misunderstanding, as an affliction which uses up nervous force
                unnecessarily—we deny that anything can be done perfectly so long as it
                is done consciously. The “pure spirit” is a piece of pure stupidity:
                take away the nervous system and the senses, the so-called “mortal
                shell,” and <i>the rest is miscalculation</i>—that is all!...</p>

                <p>Under Christianity neither morality nor religion has any point of
                contact with actuality. It offers purely imaginary <i>causes</i> (“God<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original omitted this comma.">,</ins>”
                “soul,” “ego,” “spirit,” “free will”—or even “unfree”), and purely

                “forgiveness of sins”). Intercourse between imaginary <i>beings</i> (“God,”
                “spirits,” “souls”); an imaginary <i>natural history</i> (anthropocentric; a
                total denial of the concept of natural causes); an imaginary
                <i>psychology</i> (misunderstandings of self, misinterpretations of agreeable
                or disagreeable general feelings—for example, of the states of the
                <i>nervus sympathicus</i> with the help of the sign-language of
                religio-ethical balderdash—, “repentance,” “pangs of conscience,”
                “temptation by the devil,” “the presence of God”); an imaginary
                <i>teleology</i> (the “kingdom of God,” “the last judgment,” “eternal
                life”).—This purely <i>fictitious world</i>, greatly to its disadvantage, is
                to be differentiated from the world of dreams; the latter at least
                reflects reality, whereas the former falsifies it, cheapens it and
                denies it. Once the concept of “nature” had<span class="pagenum" title="Page 62"> </span><a id="Page_62"></a> been opposed to the concept
                of “God,” the word “natural” necessarily took on the meaning of
                “abominable”—the whole of that fictitious world has its sources in
                hatred of the natural (—the real!—), and is no more than evidence of a
                profound uneasiness in the presence of reality.... <i>This explains
                everything.</i> Who alone has any reason for living his way out of reality?
                The man who suffers under it. But to suffer from reality one must be a
                <i>botched</i> reality.... The preponderance of pains over pleasures is the
                cause of this fictitious morality and religion: but such a preponderance
                also supplies the formula for <i>décadence</i>....</p>
                <h3>16.</h3>
                <p>A criticism of the <i>Christian concept of God</i> leads inevitably to the
                same conclusion.—A nation that still believes in itself holds fast to
                its own god. In him it does honour to the conditions which enable it to
                survive, to its virtues—it projects its joy in itself, its feeling of
                power, into a being to whom one may offer thanks. He who is rich will
                give of his riches; a proud people need a god to whom they can make
                <i>sacrifices</i>.... Religion, within these<span class="pagenum" title="Page 63"> </span><a id="Page_63"></a> limits, is a form of gratitude.
                A man is grateful for his own existence: to that end he needs a
                god.—Such a god must be able to work both benefits and injuries; he
                must be able to play either friend or foe—he is wondered at for the
                good he does as well as for the evil he does. But the castration,
                against all nature, of such a god, making him a god of goodness alone,
                would be contrary to human inclination. Mankind has just as much need
                for an evil god as for a good god; it doesn’t have to thank mere
                tolerance and humanitarianism for its own existence.... What would be
                the value of a god who knew nothing of anger, revenge, envy, scorn,
                cunning, violence? who had perhaps never experienced the rapturous
                <i>ardeurs</i> of victory and of destruction? No one would understand such a
                god: why should any one want him?—True enough, when a nation is on the
                downward path, when it feels its belief in its own future, its hope of
                freedom slipping from it, when it begins to see submission as a first
                necessity and the virtues of submission as measures of
                self-preservation, then it <i>must</i> overhaul its god. He then becomes a
                hypocrite, timorous and demure; he counsels “peace of<span class="pagenum" title="Page 64"> </span><a id="Page_64"></a> soul,”
                hate-no-more, leniency, “love” of friend and foe. He moralizes
                endlessly; he creeps into every private virtue; he becomes the god of
                every man; he becomes a private citizen, a cosmopolitan.... Formerly he
                represented a people, the strength of a people, everything aggressive
                and thirsty for power in the soul of a people; now he is simply <i>the
                good god</i>.... The truth is that there is no other alternative for gods:
                <i>either</i> they are the will to power—in which case they are national
                gods—<i>or</i> incapacity for power—in which case they have to be good....</p>
                <h3>17.</h3>
                <p>Wherever the will to power begins to decline, in whatever form, there is
                always an accompanying decline physiologically, a <i>décadence</i>. The
                divinity of this <i>décadence</i>, shorn of its masculine virtues and
                passions, is converted perforce into a god of the physiologically
                degraded, of the weak. Of course, they do not <i>call</i> themselves the
                weak; they call themselves “the good.”... No hint is needed to indicate
                the moments in history at which the dualistic fiction of a good and an
                evil god first became<span class="pagenum" title="Page 65"> </span><a id="Page_65"></a> possible. The same instinct which prompts the
                inferior to reduce their own god to “goodness-in-itself” also prompts
                them to eliminate all good qualities from the god of their superiors;
                they make revenge on their masters by making a <i>devil</i> of the latter’s
                god.—The <i>good</i> god, and the devil like him—both are abortions of
                <i>décadence</i>.—How can we be so tolerant of the naïveté of Christian
                theologians as to join in their doctrine that the evolution of the
                concept of god from “the god of Israel,” the god of a people, to the
                Christian god, the essence of all goodness, is to be described as
                <i>progress</i>?—But even Renan does this. As if Renan had a right to be
                naïve! The contrary actually stares one in the face. When everything
                necessary to <i>ascending</i> life; when all that is strong, courageous,
                masterful and proud has been eliminated from the concept of a god; when
                he has sunk step by step to the level of a staff for the weary, a
                sheet-anchor for the drowning; when he becomes the poor man’s god, the
                sinner’s god, the invalid’s god <i>par excellence</i>, and the attribute of
                “saviour” or “redeemer” remains as the one essential attribute of
                divinity—just <i>what</i> is the significance of such a metamorphosis?
                what<span class="pagenum" title="Page 66"> </span><a id="Page_66"></a> does such a <i>reduction</i> of the godhead imply?—To be
                sure, the “kingdom of God” has thus grown larger. Formerly he had only
                his own people, his “chosen” people. But since then he has gone
                wandering, like his people themselves, into foreign parts; he has given
                up settling down quietly anywhere; finally he has come to feel at home
                everywhere, and is the great cosmopolitan—until now he has the “great
                majority” on his side, and half the earth. But this god of the “great
                majority,” this democrat among gods, has not become a proud heathen god:
                on the contrary, he remains a Jew, he remains a god in a corner, a god
                of all the dark nooks and crevices, of all the noisesome quarters of the
                world!... His earthly kingdom, now as always, is a kingdom of the
                underworld, a <i>souterrain</i> kingdom, a ghetto kingdom.... And he himself
                is so pale, so weak, so <i>décadent</i>.... Even the palest of the pale are
                able to master him—messieurs the metaphysicians, those albinos of the
                intellect. They spun their webs around him for so long that finally he
                was hypnotized, and began to spin himself, and became another
                metaphysician. Thereafter he resumed once more his old busi<span class="pagenum" title="Page 67"> </span><a id="Page_67"></a>ness of
                spinning the world out of his inmost being <i>sub specie Spinozae</i>;
                thereafter he became ever thinner and paler—became the “ideal,” became
                “pure spirit,” became “the absolute,” became “the thing-in-itself.”...
                <i>The collapse of a god</i>: he became a “thing-in-itself.”</p>
                <h3>18.</h3>
                <p>The Christian concept of a god—the god as the patron of the sick, the
                god as a spinner of cobwebs, the god as a spirit—is one of the most
                corrupt concepts that has ever been set up in the world: it probably
                touches low-water mark in the ebbing evolution of the god-type. God
                degenerated into the <i>contradiction of life</i>. Instead of being its
                transfiguration and eternal Yea! In him war is declared on life, on
                nature, on the will to live! God becomes the formula for every slander
                upon the “here and now,” and for every lie about the “beyond”! In him
                nothingness is deified, and the will to nothingness is made holy!...</p>
                <h3>19.</h3>
                <p>The fact that the strong races of northern Europe did not repudiate this
                Christian god does<span class="pagenum" title="Page 68"> </span><a id="Page_68"></a> little credit to their gift for religion—and not
                much more to their taste. They ought to have been able to make an end of
                such a moribund and worn-out product of the <i>décadence</i>. A curse lies
                upon them because they were not equal to it; they made illness,
                decrepitude and contradiction a part of their instincts—and since then
                they have not managed to <i>create</i> any more gods. Two thousand years have
                come and gone—and not a single new god! Instead, there still exists,
                and as if by some intrinsic right,—as if he were the <i>ultimatum</i> and
                <i>maximum</i> of the power to create gods, of the <i>creator spiritus</i> in
                mankind—this pitiful god of Christian monotono-theism! This hybrid
                image of decay, conjured up out of emptiness, contradiction and vain
                imagining, in which all the instincts of <i>décadence</i>, all the cowardices
                and wearinesses of the soul find their sanction!—</p>
                <h3>20.</h3>
                <p>In my condemnation of Christianity I surely hope I do no injustice to a
                related religion with an even larger number of believers: I allude to
                <i>Buddhism</i>. Both are to be reckoned among the nihilistic religions—they
                are both <i>décadence</i><span class="pagenum" title="Page 69"> </span><a id="Page_69"></a> religions—but they are separated from each other
                in a very remarkable way. For the fact that he is able to <i>compare</i> them
                at all the critic of Christianity is indebted to the scholars of
                India.—Buddhism is a hundred times as realistic as Christianity—it is
                part of its living heritage that it is able to face problems objectively
                and coolly; it is the product of long centuries of <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original read ‘philosohical.’">philosophical</ins> speculation. The concept, “god,” was already disposed
                of before it appeared. Buddhism is the only genuinely <i>positive</i>
                religion to be encountered in history, and this applies even to its
                epistemology (which is a strict phenomenalism). It does not speak of a
                “struggle with sin,” but, yielding to reality, of the “struggle with
                suffering.” Sharply differentiating itself from Christianity, it puts
                the self-deception that lies in moral concepts behind it; it is, in my
                phrase, <i>beyond</i> good and evil.—The two physiological facts upon which
                it grounds itself and upon which it bestows its chief attention are:
                first, an excessive sensitiveness to sensation, which manifests itself
                as a refined susceptibility to pain, and <i>secondly</i>, an extraordinary
                spirituality, a too protracted concern with concepts and logical
                procedures, under<span class="pagenum" title="Page 70"> </span><a id="Page_70"></a> the influence of which the instinct of personality
                has yielded to a notion of the “impersonal.” (—Both of these states
                will be familiar to a few of my readers, the objectivists, by
                experience, as they are to me). These physiological states produced a
                <i>depression</i>, and Buddha tried to combat it by hygienic measures.
                Against it he prescribed a life in the open, a life of travel;
                moderation in eating and a careful selection of foods; caution in the
                use of intoxicants; the same caution in arousing any of the passions
                that foster a bilious habit and heat the blood; finally, no <i>worry</i>,
                either on one’s own account or on account of others. He encourages ideas
                that make for either quiet contentment or good cheer—he finds means to
                combat ideas of other sorts. He understands good, the state of goodness,
                as something which promotes health. <i>Prayer</i> is not included, and
                neither is <i>asceticism</i>. There is no categorical imperative nor any
                disciplines, even within the walls of a monastery (—it is always
                possible to leave—). These things would have been simply means of
                increasing the excessive sensitiveness above mentioned. For the same
                reason he does not advocate any conflict with unbelievers; his teaching<span class="pagenum" title="Page 71"> </span><a id="Page_71"></a>
                is antagonistic to nothing so much as to revenge, aversion,
                <i>ressentiment</i> (—“enmity never brings an end to enmity”: the moving
                refrain of all Buddhism....) And in all this he was right, for it is
                precisely these passions which, in view of his main regiminal purpose,
                are <i>unhealthful</i>. The mental fatigue that he observes, already plainly
                displayed in too much “objectivity” (that is, in the individual’s loss
                of interest in himself, in loss of balance and of “egoism”), he combats
                by strong efforts to lead even the spiritual interests back to the
                <i>ego</i>. In Buddha’s teaching egoism is a duty. The “one thing needful,”
                the question “how can you be delivered from suffering,” regulates and
                determines the whole spiritual diet. (—Perhaps one will here recall
                that Athenian who also declared war upon pure “scientificality,” to wit,
                Socrates, who also elevated egoism to the estate of a morality).</p>
                <h3>21.</h3>
                <p>The things necessary to Buddhism are a very mild climate, customs of
                great gentleness and liberality, and <i>no</i> militarism; moreover, it must
                get its start among the higher and better edu<span class="pagenum" title="Page 72"> </span><a id="Page_72"></a>cated classes.
                Cheerfulness, quiet and the absence of desire are the chief desiderata,
                and they are <i>attained</i>. Buddhism is not a religion in which perfection
                is merely an object of aspiration: perfection is actually normal.—</p>
                <p>Under Christianity the instincts of the subjugated and the oppressed
                come to the fore: it is only those who are at the bottom who seek their
                salvation in it. Here the prevailing pastime, the favourite remedy for
                boredom is the discussion of sin, self-criticism, the inquisition of
                conscience; here the emotion produced by <i>power</i> (called “God”) is
                pumped up (by prayer); here the highest good is regarded as
                unattainable, as a gift, as “grace.” Here, too, open dealing is lacking;
                concealment and the darkened room are Christian. Here body is despised
                and hygiene is denounced as sensual; the church even ranges itself
                against cleanliness (—the first Christian order after the banishment of
                the Moors closed the public baths, of which there were 270 in Cordova
                alone). Christian, too, is a certain cruelty toward one’s self and
                toward others; hatred of unbelievers; the will to persecute. Sombre and
                disquieting ideas are in the foreground; the most esteemed states of<span class="pagenum" title="Page 73"> </span><a id="Page_73"></a>
                mind, bearing the most respectable names, are epileptoid; the diet is so
                regulated as to engender morbid symptoms and over-stimulate the nerves.
                Christian, again, is all deadly enmity to the rulers of the earth, to
                the “aristocratic”—along with a sort of secret rivalry with them (—one
                resigns one’s “body” to them; one wants <i>only</i> one’s “soul”...). And
                Christian is all hatred of the intellect, of pride, of courage, of
                freedom, of intellectual <i>libertinage</i>; Christian is all hatred of the
                senses, of joy in the senses, of joy in general....</p>
                <h3>22.</h3>
                <p>When Christianity departed from its native soil, that of the lowest
                orders, the <i>underworld</i> of the ancient world, and began seeking power
                among barbarian peoples, it no longer had to deal with <i>exhausted</i> men,
                but with men still inwardly savage and capable of self-torture—in
                brief, strong men, but bungled men. Here, unlike in the case of the
                Buddhists, the cause of discontent with self, suffering through self, is
                <i>not</i> merely a general sensitiveness and susceptibility to pain, but, on
                the contrary, an inordinate thirst for inflicting pain on others, a
                tendency<span class="pagenum" title="Page 74"> </span><a id="Page_74"></a> to obtain subjective satisfaction in hostile deeds and ideas.
                Christianity had to embrace <i>barbaric</i> concepts and valuations in order
                to obtain mastery over barbarians: of such sort, for example, are the
                sacrifices of the first-born, the drinking of blood as a sacrament, the
                disdain of the intellect and of culture; torture in all its forms,
                whether bodily or not; the whole pomp of the cult. Buddhism is a
                religion for peoples in a further state of development, for races that
                have become kind, gentle and over-spiritualized (—Europe is not yet
                ripe for it—): it is a summons that takes them back to peace and
                cheerfulness, to a careful rationing of the spirit, to a certain
                hardening of the body. Christianity aims at mastering <i>beasts of prey</i>;
                its modus operandi is to make them <i>ill</i>—to make feeble is the
                Christian recipe for taming, for “<i>civilizing</i>.” Buddhism is a religion
                for the closing, over-wearied stages of civilization. Christianity
                appears before civilization has so much as begun—under certain
                circumstances it lays the very foundations thereof.</p>
                <h3><span class="pagenum" title="Page 75"> </span><a id="Page_75"></a>23.</h3>
                <p>Buddhism, I repeat, is a hundred times more austere, more honest, more
                objective. It no longer has to <i>justify</i> its pains, its susceptibility
                to suffering, by interpreting these things in terms of sin—it simply
                says, as it simply thinks, “I suffer.” To the barbarian, however,
                suffering in itself is scarcely understandable: what he needs, first of
                all, is an explanation as to <i>why</i> he suffers. (His mere instinct
                prompts him to deny his suffering altogether, or to endure it in
                silence.) Here the word “devil” was a blessing: man had to have an
                omnipotent and terrible enemy—there was no need to be ashamed of
                suffering at the hands of such an enemy.—</p>
                <p>At the bottom of Christianity there are several subtleties that belong
                to the Orient. In the first place, it knows that it is of very little
                consequence whether a thing be true or not, so long as it is <i>believed</i>
                to be true. Truth and <i>faith</i>: here we have two wholly distinct worlds
                of ideas, almost two diametrically <i>opposite</i> worlds—the road to the
                one and the road to the other lie miles apart. To understand that fact
                thoroughly—this is almost enough, in the Orient, to <i>make</i> one<span class="pagenum" title="Page 76"> </span><a id="Page_76"></a> a sage.
                The Brahmins knew it, Plato knew it, every student of the esoteric knows
                it. When, for example, a man gets any <i>pleasure</i> out of the notion that
                he has been saved from sin, it is <i>not</i> necessary for him to be actually
                sinful, but merely to <i>feel</i> sinful. But when <i>faith</i> is thus exalted
                above everything else, it necessarily follows that reason, knowledge and
                patient inquiry have to be discredited: the road to the truth becomes a
                forbidden road.—Hope, in its stronger forms, is a great deal more
                powerful <i>stimulans</i> to life than any sort of realized joy can ever be.
                Man must be sustained in suffering by a hope so high that no conflict
                with actuality can dash it—so high, indeed, that no fulfilment can
                <i>satisfy</i> it: a hope reaching out beyond this world. (Precisely because
                of this power that hope has of making the suffering hold out, the Greeks
                regarded it as the evil of evils, as the most <i>malign</i> of evils; it
                remained behind at the source of all evil.)<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a>—In order that <i>love</i> may
                be possible, God must become a person; in order that the lower instincts
                may take a hand in the matter God must be young. To satisfy the ardor of
                the woman a beautiful<span class="pagenum" title="Page 77"> </span><a id="Page_77"></a> saint must appear on the scene, and to satisfy
                that of the men there must be a virgin. These things are necessary if
                Christianity is to assume lordship over a soil on which some
                aphrodisiacal or Adonis cult has already established a notion as to what
                a cult ought to be. To insist upon <i>chastity</i> greatly strengthens the
                vehemence and subjectivity of the religious instinct—it makes the cult
                warmer, more enthusiastic, more soulful.—Love is the state in which man
                sees things most decidedly as they are <i>not</i>. The force of illusion
                reaches its highest here, and so does the capacity for sweetening, for
                <i>transfiguring</i>. When a man is in love he endures more than at any other
                time; he submits to anything. The problem was to devise a religion which
                would allow one to love: by this means the worst that life has to offer
                is overcome—it is scarcely even noticed.—So much for the three
                Christian virtues: faith, hope and charity: I call them the three
                Christian <i>ingenuities</i>.—Buddhism is in too late a stage of
                development, too full of positivism, to be shrewd in any such way.—</p>

                <h3><span class="pagenum" title="Page 78"> </span><a id="Page_78"></a>24.</h3>
                <p>Here I barely touch upon the problem of the <i>origin</i> of Christianity.
                The <i>first</i> thing necessary to its solution is this: that Christianity
                is to be understood only by examining the soil from which it sprung—it
                is <i>not</i> a reaction against Jewish instincts; it is their inevitable
                product; it is simply one more step in the awe-inspiring logic of the
                Jews. In the words of the Saviour, “salvation is of the Jews.”<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a>—The
                <i>second</i> thing to remember is this: that the psychological type of the
                Galilean is still to be recognized, but it was only in its most
                degenerate form (which is at once maimed and overladen with foreign
                features) that it could serve in the manner in which it has been used:
                as a type of the <i>Saviour</i> of mankind.—</p>
                <div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_4_4"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_4_4" class="pginternal">[4]</a></span> John iv, 22.</p></div>
                <p>The Jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world, for
                when they were confronted with the question, to be or not to be, they
                chose, with perfectly unearthly deliberation, to be <i>at any price</i>: this
                price involved a radical <i>falsification</i> of all nature, of all
                naturalness, of all reality, of the whole inner world,<span class="pagenum" title="Page 79"> </span><a id="Page_79"></a> as well as of
                the outer. They put themselves <i>against</i> all those conditions under
                which, hitherto, a people had been able to live, or had even been
                <i>permitted</i> to live; out of themselves they evolved an idea which stood
                in direct opposition to <i>natural</i> conditions—one by one they distorted
                religion, civilization, morality, history and psychology until each
                became a <i>contradiction</i> of its <i>natural significance</i>. We meet with the
                same phenomenon later on, in an incalculably exaggerated form, but only
                as a copy: the Christian church, put beside the “people of God,” shows a
                complete lack of any claim to originality. Precisely for this reason the
                Jews are the most <i>fateful</i> people in the history of the world: their
                influence has so falsified the reasoning of mankind in this matter that
                today the Christian can cherish anti-Semitism without realizing that it
                is no more than the <i>final consequence of Judaism</i>.</p>
                <p>In my “Genealogy of Morals” I give the first psychological explanation
                of the concepts underlying those two antithetical things, a <i>noble</i>
                morality and a <i>ressentiment</i> morality, the second of which is a mere
                product of the denial of the former. The Judaeo-Christian moral<span class="pagenum" title="Page 80"> </span><a id="Page_80"></a> system
                belongs to the second division, and in every detail. In order to be able
                to say Nay to everything representing an <i>ascending</i> evolution of
                life—that is, to well-being, to power, to beauty, to self-approval—the
                instincts of <i>ressentiment</i>, here become downright genius, had to invent
                an <i>other</i> world in which the <i>acceptance of life</i> appeared as the most
                evil and abominable thing imaginable. Psychologically, the Jews are a
                people gifted with the very strongest vitality, so much so that when
                they found themselves facing impossible conditions of life they chose
                voluntarily, and with a profound talent for self-preservation, the side
                of all those instincts which make for <i>décadence</i>—<i>not</i> as if mastered
                by them, but as if detecting in them a power by which “the world” could
                be <i>defied</i>. The Jews are the very opposite of <i>décadents</i>: they have
                simply been forced into <i>appearing</i> in that guise, and with a degree of
                skill approaching the <i>non plus ultra</i> of histrionic genius they have
                managed to put themselves at the head of all <i>décadent</i> movements (—for
                example, the Christianity of Paul—), and so make of them something
                stronger than any party frankly saying <i>Yes</i> to<span class="pagenum" title="Page 81"> </span><a id="Page_81"></a> life. To the sort of
                men who reach out for power under Judaism and Christianity,—that is to
                say, to the <i>priestly</i> class—<i>décadence</i> is no more than a means to an
                end. Men of this sort have a vital interest in making mankind sick, and
                in confusing the values of “good” and “bad,” “true” and “false” in a
                manner that is not only dangerous to life, but also slanders it.</p>
                <h3>25.</h3>
                <p>The history of Israel is invaluable as a typical history of an attempt
                to <i>denaturize</i> all natural values: I point to five facts which bear
                this out. Originally, and above all in the time of the monarchy, Israel
                maintained the <i>right</i> attitude of things, which is to say, the natural
                attitude. Its Jahveh was an expression of its consciousness of power,
                its joy in itself, its hopes for itself: to him the Jews looked for
                victory and salvation and through him they expected nature to give them
                whatever was necessary to their existence—above all, rain. Jahveh is
                the god of Israel, and <i>consequently</i> the god of justice: this is the
                logic of every race that has power in its hands and a good conscience in
                the use of it. In the religious ceremonial of the<span class="pagenum" title="Page 82"> </span><a id="Page_82"></a> Jews both aspects of
                this self-approval stand revealed. The nation is grateful for the high
                destiny that has enabled it to obtain dominion; it is grateful for the
                benign procession of the seasons, and for the good fortune attending its
                herds and its crops.—This view of things remained an ideal for a long
                while, even after it had been robbed of validity by tragic blows:
                anarchy within and the Assyrian without. But the people still retained,
                as a projection of their highest yearnings, that vision of a king who
                was at once a gallant warrior and an upright judge—a vision best
                visualized in the typical prophet (<i>i. e.</i>, critic and satirist of the
                moment), Isaiah.—But every hope remained unfulfilled. The old god no
                longer <i>could</i> do what he used to do. He ought to have been abandoned.
                But what actually happened? Simply this: the conception of him was
                <i>changed</i>—the conception of him was <i>denaturized</i>; this was the price
                that had to be paid for keeping him.—Jahveh, the god of “justice”—he
                is in accord with Israel <i>no more</i>, he no longer vizualizes the national
                egoism; he is now a god only conditionally.... The public notion of this
                god now becomes merely a<span class="pagenum" title="Page 83"> </span><a id="Page_83"></a> weapon in the hands of clerical agitators, who
                interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment
                for obedience or disobedience to him, for “sin”: that most fraudulent of
                all imaginable interpretations, whereby a “moral order of the world” is
                set up, and the fundamental concepts, “cause” and “effect,” are stood on
                their heads. Once natural causation has been swept out of the world by
                doctrines of reward and punishment some sort of <i>un</i>-natural causation
                becomes necessary: and all other varieties of the denial of nature
                follow it. A god who <i>demands</i>—in place of a god who helps, who gives
                counsel, who is at bottom merely a name for every happy inspiration of
                courage and self-reliance.... <i>Morality</i> is no longer a reflection of
                the conditions which make for the sound life and development of the
                people; it is no longer the primary life-instinct; instead it has become
                abstract and in opposition to life—a fundamental perversion of the
                fancy, an “evil eye” on all things. <i>What</i> is Jewish, <i>what</i> is
                Christian morality? Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted
                with the idea of “sin”; well-being represented<span class="pagenum" title="Page 84"> </span><a id="Page_84"></a> as a danger, as a
                “temptation”; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of
                conscience....</p>
                <h3>26.</h3>
                <p>The concept of god falsified; the concept of morality falsified;—but
                even here Jewish priest-craft did not stop. The whole history of Israel
                ceased to be of any value: out with it!—These priests accomplished that
                miracle of falsification of which a great part of the Bible is the
                documentary evidence; with a degree of contempt unparalleled, and in the
                face of all tradition and all historical reality, they translated the
                past of their people into <i>religious</i> terms, which is to say, they
                converted it into an idiotic mechanism of salvation, whereby all
                offences against Jahveh were punished and all devotion to him was
                rewarded. We would regard this act of historical falsification as
                something far more shameful if familiarity with the <i>ecclesiastical</i>
                interpretation of history for thousands of years had not blunted our
                inclinations for uprightness <i>in historicis</i>. And the philosophers
                support the church: the <i>lie</i> about a “moral order of the world” runs
                through the whole of philosophy,<span class="pagenum" title="Page 85"> </span><a id="Page_85"></a> even the newest. What is the meaning
                of a “moral order of the world”? That there is a thing called the will
                of God which, once and for all time, determines what man ought to do and
                what he ought not to do; that the worth of a people, or of an individual
                thereof, is to be measured by the extent to which they or he obey this
                will of God; that the destinies of a people or of an individual are
                <i>controlled</i> by this will of God, which rewards or punishes according to
                the degree of obedience manifested.—In place of all that pitiable lie
                <i>reality</i> has this to say: the <i>priest</i>, a parasitical variety of man
                who can exist only at the cost of every sound view of life, takes the
                name of God in vain: he calls that state of human society in which he
                himself determines the value of all things “the kingdom of God”; he
                calls the means whereby that state of affairs is attained “the will of
                God”; with cold-blooded cynicism he estimates all peoples, all ages and
                all individuals by the extent of their subservience or opposition to the
                power of the priestly order. One observes him at work: under the hand of
                the Jewish priesthood the <i>great</i> age of Israel became an age of
                decline; the Exile, with its long series of misfortunes, was<span class="pagenum" title="Page 86"> </span><a id="Page_86"></a>
                transformed into a <i>punishment</i> for that great age—during which priests
                had not yet come into existence. Out of the powerful and <i>wholly free</i>
                heroes of Israel’s history they fashioned, according to their changing
                needs, either wretched bigots and hypocrites or men entirely “godless.”
                They reduced every great event to the idiotic formula: “obedient <i>or</i>
                disobedient to God.”—They went a step further: the “will of God” (in
                other words some means necessary for preserving the power of the
                priests) had to be <i>determined</i>—and to this end they had to have a
                “revelation.” In plain English, a gigantic literary fraud had to be
                perpetrated, and “holy scriptures” had to be concocted—and so, with the
                utmost hierarchical pomp, and days of penance and much lamentation over
                the long days of “sin” now ended, they were duly published. The “will of
                God,” it appears, had long stood like a rock; the trouble was that
                mankind had neglected the “holy scriptures”.... But the “will of God”
                had already been revealed to Moses.... What happened? Simply this: the
                priest had formulated, once and for all time and with the strictest
                meticulousness, what tithes were to be paid to him, from the largest to
                the<span class="pagenum" title="Page 87"> </span><a id="Page_87"></a> smallest (—not forgetting the most appetizing cuts of meat, for
                the priest is a great consumer of beefsteaks); in brief, he let it be
                known just <i>what he wanted</i>, what “the will of God” was.... From this
                time forward things were so arranged that the priest became
                <i>indispensable everywhere</i>; at all the great natural events of life, at
                birth, at marriage, in sickness, at death, not to say at the
                “<i>sacrifice</i>” (that is, at meal-times), the holy parasite put in his
                appearance, and proceeded to <i>denaturize</i> it—in his own phrase, to
                “sanctify” it.... For this should be noted: that every natural habit,
                every natural institution (the state, the administration of justice,
                marriage, the care of the sick and of the poor), everything demanded by
                the life-instinct, in short, everything that has any value <i>in itself</i>,
                is reduced to absolute worthlessness and even made the <i>reverse</i> of
                valuable by the parasitism of priests (or, if you chose, by the “moral
                order of the world”). The fact requires a sanction—a power to <i>grant
                values</i> becomes necessary, and the only way it can create such values is
                by denying nature.... The priest depreciates and desecrates nature: it
                is only at this price that he can exist at all.—Disobedience to God,
                which<span class="pagenum" title="Page 88"> </span><a id="Page_88"></a> actually means to the priest, to “the law,” now gets the name of
                “sin”; the means prescribed for “reconciliation with God” are, of
                course, precisely the means which bring one most effectively under the
                thumb of the priest; he alone can “save”.... Psychologically considered,
                “sins” are indispensable to every society organized on an ecclesiastical
                basis; they are the only reliable weapons of power; the priest <i>lives</i>
                upon sins; it is necessary to him that there be “sinning”.... Prime
                axiom: “God forgiveth him that repenteth”—in plain English, <i>him that
                submitteth to the priest</i>.</p>
                <h3>27.</h3>
                <p>Christianity sprang from a soil so corrupt that on it everything
                natural, every natural value, every <i>reality</i> was opposed by the deepest
                instincts of the ruling class—it grew up as a sort of war to the death
                upon reality, and as such it has never been surpassed. The “holy
                people,” who had adopted priestly values and priestly names for all
                things, and who, with a terrible logical consistency, had rejected
                everything of the earth as “unholy,” “worldly,” “sinful”—this people
                put its instinct into a final for<span class="pagenum" title="Page 89"> </span><a id="Page_89"></a>mula that was logical to the point of
                self-annihilation: as <i>Christianity</i> it actually denied even the last
                form of reality, the “holy people,” the “chosen people,” <i>Jewish</i>
                reality itself. The phenomenon is of the first order of importance: the
                small insurrectionary movement which took the name of Jesus of Nazareth
                is simply the Jewish instinct <i>redivivus</i>—in other words, it is the
                priestly instinct come to such a pass that it can no longer endure the
                priest as a fact; it is the discovery of a state of existence even more
                fantastic than any before it, of a vision of life even more <i>unreal</i>
                than that necessary to an ecclesiastical organization. Christianity
                actually <i>denies</i> the church....</p>
                <p>I am unable to determine what was the target of the insurrection said to
                have been led (whether rightly or <i>wrongly</i>) by Jesus, if it was not the
                Jewish church—“church” being here used in exactly the same sense that
                the word has today. It was an insurrection against the “good and just,”
                against the “prophets of Israel,” against the whole hierarchy of
                society—<i>not</i> against corruption, but against caste, privilege, order,
                formalism. It was <i>unbelief</i> in “superior men,” a Nay flung at
                everything<span class="pagenum" title="Page 90"> </span><a id="Page_90"></a> that priests and theologians stood for. But the hierarchy
                that was called into question, if only for an instant, by this movement
                was the structure of piles which, above everything, was necessary to the
                safety of the Jewish people in the midst of the “waters”—it represented
                their <i>last</i> possibility of survival; it was the final <i>residuum</i> of
                their independent political existence; an attack upon it was an attack
                upon the most profound national instinct, the most powerful national
                will to live, that has ever appeared on earth. This saintly anarchist,
                who aroused the people of the abyss, the outcasts and “sinners,” the
                Chandala of Judaism, to rise in revolt against the established order of
                things—and in language which, if the Gospels are to be credited, would
                get him sent to Siberia today—this man was certainly a political
                criminal, at least in so far as it was possible to be one in so
                <i>absurdly unpolitical</i> a community. This is what brought him to the
                cross: the proof thereof is to be found in the inscription that was put
                upon the cross. He died for his <i>own</i> sins—there is not the slightest
                ground for believing, no matter how often it is asserted, that he died
                for the sins of others.<span class="pagenum" title="Page 91"> </span><a id="Page_91"></a>—</p>
                <h3>28.</h3>
                <p>As to whether he himself was conscious of this contradiction—whether,
                in fact, this was the only contradiction he was cognizant of—that is
                quite another question. Here, for the first time, I touch upon the
                problem of the <i>psychology of the Saviour</i>.—I confess, to begin with,
                that there are very few books which offer me harder reading than the
                Gospels. My difficulties are quite different from those which enabled
                the learned curiosity of the German mind to achieve one of its most
                unforgettable triumphs. It is a long while since I, like all other young
                scholars, enjoyed with all the sapient laboriousness of a fastidious
                philologist the work of the incomparable Strauss.<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a> At that time I was
                twenty years old: now I am too serious for that sort of thing. What do I
                care for the contradictions of “tradition”? How can any one call pious
                legends “traditions”? The histories of saints present the most dubious
                variety of literature in existence; to examine them by the scientific
                method, <i>in the entire ab<span class="pagenum" title="Page 92"> </span><a id="Page_92"></a>sence of corroborative documents</i>, seems to me
                to condemn the whole inquiry from the start—it is simply learned
                idling....</p>

                <h3>29.</h3>
                <p>What concerns <i>me</i> is the psychological type of the Saviour. This type
                might be depicted in the Gospels, in however mutilated a form and
                however much overladen with extraneous characters—that is, in <i>spite</i>
                of the Gospels; just as the figure of Francis of Assisi shows itself in
                his legends in spite of his legends. It is <i>not</i> a question of mere
                truthful evidence as to what he did, what he said and how he actually
                died; the question is, whether his type is still conceivable, whether it
                has been handed down to us.—All the attempts that I know of to read the
                <i>history</i> of a “soul” in the Gospels seem to me to reveal only a
                lamentable psychological levity. M. Renan, that mountebank <i>in
                psychologicus</i>, has contributed the two most <i>unseemly</i> notions to this
                business of explaining the type of Jesus: the notion of the <i>genius</i> and
                that of the <i>hero</i> (“<i>héros</i>”). But if there is anything essentially
                unevangelical, it is surely the concept of the hero. What the Gospels
                make instinctive<span class="pagenum" title="Page 93"> </span><a id="Page_93"></a> is precisely the reverse of all heroic struggle, of
                all taste for conflict: the very incapacity for resistance is here
                converted into something moral: (“resist not evil!”—the most profound
                sentence in the Gospels, perhaps the true key to them), to wit, the
                blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the <i>inability</i> to be an enemy.
                What is the meaning of “glad tidings”?—The true life, the life eternal
                has been found—it is not merely promised, it is here, it is in <i>you</i>;
                it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions,
                from all keeping of distances. Every one is the child of God—Jesus
                claims nothing for himself alone—as the child of God each man is the
                equal of every other man.... Imagine making Jesus a <i>hero</i>!—And what a
                tremendous misunderstanding appears in the word “genius”! Our whole
                conception of the “spiritual,” the whole conception of our civilization,
                could have had no meaning in the world that Jesus lived in. In the
                strict sense of the physiologist, a quite different word ought to be
                used here.... We all know that there is a morbid sensibility of the
                tactile nerves which causes those suffering from it to recoil from every
                touch, and from every effort to grasp a<span class="pagenum" title="Page 94"> </span><a id="Page_94"></a> solid object. Brought to its
                logical conclusion, such a physiological <i>habitus</i> becomes an
                instinctive hatred of all reality, a flight into the “intangible,” into
                the “incomprehensible”; a distaste for all formulae, for all conceptions
                of time and space, for everything established—customs, institutions,
                the church—; a feeling of being at home in a world in which no sort of
                reality survives, a merely “inner” world, a “true” world, an “eternal”
                world.... “The Kingdom of God is within <i>you</i>”....</p>
                <h3>30.</h3>
                <p><i>The instinctive hatred of reality</i>: the consequence of an extreme
                susceptibility to pain and irritation—so great that merely to be
                “touched” becomes unendurable, for every sensation is too profound.</p>
                <p><i>The instinctive exclusion of all aversion, all hostility, all bounds
                and distances in feeling</i>: the consequence of an extreme susceptibility
                to pain and irritation—so great that it senses all resistance, all
                compulsion to resistance, as unbearable <i>anguish</i> (—that is to say, as
                <i>harmful</i>, as <i>prohibited</i> by the instinct of self-preservation), and
                regards blessedness (joy) as possible<span class="pagenum" title="Page 95"> </span><a id="Page_95"></a> only when it is no longer
                necessary to offer resistance to anybody or anything, however evil or
                dangerous—love, as the only, as the <i>ultimate</i> possibility of life....</p>
                <p>These are the two <i>physiological realities</i> upon and out of which the
                doctrine of salvation has sprung. I call them a sublime
                super-development of hedonism upon a thoroughly unsalubrious soil. What
                stands most closely related to them, though with a large admixture of
                Greek vitality and nerve-force, is epicureanism, the theory of salvation
                of paganism. Epicurus was a <i>typical décadent</i>: I was the first to
                recognize him.—The fear of pain, even of infinitely slight pain—the
                end of this <i>can</i> be nothing save a <i>religion of love</i>....</p>
                <h3>31.</h3>
                <p>I have already given my answer to the problem. The prerequisite to it is
                the assumption that the type of the Saviour has reached us only in a
                greatly distorted form. This distortion is very probable: there are many
                reasons why a type of that sort should not be handed down in a pure
                form, complete and free of additions. The milieu in which this strange
                figure moved<span class="pagenum" title="Page 96"> </span><a id="Page_96"></a> must have left marks upon him, and more must have been
                imprinted by the history, the <i>destiny</i>, of the early Christian
                communities; the latter indeed, must have embellished the type
                retrospectively with characters which can be understood only as serving
                the purposes of war and of propaganda. That strange and sickly world
                into which the Gospels lead us—a world apparently out of a Russian
                novel, in which the scum of society, nervous maladies and “childish”
                idiocy keep a tryst—must, in any case, have <i>coarsened</i> the type: the
                first disciples, in particular, must have been forced to translate an
                existence visible only in symbols and incomprehensibilities into their
                own crudity, in order to understand it at all—in their sight the type
                could take on reality only after it had been recast in a familiar
                mould.... The prophet, the messiah, the future judge, the teacher of
                morals, the worker of wonders, John the Baptist—all these merely
                presented chances to misunderstand it.... Finally, let us not underrate
                the <i>proprium</i> of all great, and especially all sectarian veneration: it
                tends to erase from the venerated objects all its original traits and
                idiosyncrasies, often so painfully strange—<i>it does not even see<span class="pagenum" title="Page 97"> </span><a id="Page_97"></a>
                them</i>. It is greatly to be regretted that no Dostoyevsky lived in the
                neighbourhood of this most interesting <i>décadent</i>—I mean some one who
                would have felt the poignant charm of such a compound of the sublime,
                the morbid and the childish. In the last analysis, the type, as a type
                of the <i>décadence</i>, may actually have been peculiarly complex and
                contradictory: such a possibility is not to be lost sight of.
                Nevertheless, the probabilities seem to be against it, for in that case
                tradition would have been particularly accurate and objective, whereas
                we have reasons for assuming the contrary. Meanwhile, there is a
                contradiction between the peaceful preacher of the mount, the sea-shore
                and the fields, who appears like a new Buddha on a soil very unlike
                India’s, and the aggressive fanatic, the mortal enemy of theologians and
                ecclesiastics, who stands glorified by Renan’s malice as “<i>le grand
                maître en ironie</i>.” I myself haven’t any doubt that the greater part of
                this venom (and no less of <i>esprit</i>) got itself into the concept of the
                Master only as a result of the excited nature of Christian propaganda:
                we all know the unscrupulousness of sectarians when they set out to turn
                their leader into an <i>apologia</i><span class="pagenum" title="Page 98"> </span><a id="Page_98"></a> for themselves. When the early
                Christians had need of an adroit, contentious, pugnacious and
                maliciously subtle theologian to tackle other theologians, they
                <i>created</i> a “god” that met that need, just as they put into his mouth
                without hesitation certain ideas that were necessary to them but that
                were utterly at odds with the Gospels—“the second coming,” “the last
                judgment,” all sorts of expectations and promises, current at the
                time.—</p>
                <h3>32.</h3>
                <p>I can only repeat that I set myself against all efforts to intrude the
                fanatic into the figure of the Saviour: the very word <i>impérieux</i>, used
                by Renan, is alone enough to <i>annul</i> the type. What the “glad tidings”
                tell us is simply that there are no more contradictions; the kingdom of
                heaven belongs to <i>children</i>; the faith that is voiced here is no more
                an embattled faith—it is at hand, it has been from the beginning, it is
                a sort of recrudescent childishness of the spirit. The physiologists, at
                all events, are familiar with such a delayed and incomplete puberty in
                the living organism, the result of degeneration. A faith of this sort is
                not furious, it does not de<span class="pagenum" title="Page 99"> </span><a id="Page_99"></a>nounce, it does not defend itself: it does
                not come with “the sword”—it does not realize how it will one day set
                man against man. It does not manifest itself either by miracles, or by
                rewards and promises, or by “scriptures”: it is itself, first and last,
                its own miracle, its own reward, its own promise, its own “kingdom of
                God.” This faith does not formulate itself—it simply <i>lives</i>, and so
                guards itself against formulae. To be sure, the accident of environment,
                of educational background gives prominence to concepts of a certain
                sort: in primitive Christianity one finds <i>only</i> concepts of a
                Judaeo-Semitic character (—that of eating and drinking at the last
                supper belongs to this category—an idea which, like everything else
                Jewish, has been badly mauled by the church). But let us be careful not
                to see in all this anything more than symbolical language, semantics<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6_6">[6]</a>
                an opportunity to speak in parables. It is only on the theory that no
                work is to be taken literally that this anti-realist is able to speak at
                all. Set down among Hindus he would have made use of the concepts of
                Sankhya,<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_7">[7]</a> and among Chinese<span class="pagenum" title="Page 100"> </span><a id="Page_100"></a> he would have employed those of
                Lao-tse<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8_8">[8]</a>—and in neither case would it have made any difference to
                him.—With a little freedom in the use of words, one might actually call
                Jesus a “free spirit”<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9_9">[9]</a>—he cares nothing for what is established: the
                word <i>killeth</i>,<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10_10">[10]</a> whatever is established <i>killeth</i>. The idea of
                “life” as an <i>experience</i>, as he alone conceives it, stands opposed to
                his mind to every sort of word, formula, law, belief and dogma. He
                speaks only of inner things: “life” or “truth” or “light” is his word
                for the innermost—in his sight everything else, the whole of reality,
                all nature, even language, has significance only as sign, as
                allegory.—Here it is of paramount importance to be led into no error by
                the temptations lying in Christian, or rather <i>ecclesiastical</i>
                prejudices: such a symbolism <i>par excellence</i> stands outside all
                religion, all notions of worship, all history, all natural science, all
                worldly experience, all knowledge, all politics, all psychology, all
                books, all art—his “wisdom” is precisely a <i>pure<span class="pagenum" title="Page 101"> </span><a id="Page_101"></a> ignorance</i><a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11_11">[11]</a> of all
                such things. He has never heard of <i>culture</i>; he doesn’t have to make
                war on it—he doesn’t even deny it.... The same thing may be said of the
                <i>state</i>, of the whole bourgeoise social order, of labour, of war—he has
                no ground for denying “the world,” for he knows nothing of the
                ecclesiastical concept of “the world”.... <i>Denial</i> is precisely the
                thing that is impossible to him.—In the same way he lacks argumentative
                capacity, and has no belief that an article of faith, a “truth,” may be
                established by proofs (—<i>his</i> proofs are inner “lights,” subjective
                sensations of happiness and self-approval, simple “proofs of power”—).
                Such a doctrine <i>cannot</i> contradict: it doesn’t know that other
                doctrines exist, or <i>can</i> exist, and is wholly incapable of imagining
                anything opposed to it.... If anything of the sort is ever encountered,
                it laments the “blindness” with sincere sympathy—for it alone has
                “light”—but it does not offer objections....</p>

                anything that puts a distance between God and man, is abolished—<i>this
                is precisely the “glad tidings.”</i> Eternal bliss is not merely promised,
                nor is it bound up with conditions: it is conceived as the <i>only</i>
                reality—what remains consists merely of signs useful in speaking of it.</p>
                <p>The <i>results</i> of such a point of view project themselves into a new <i>way
                of life</i>, the special evangelical way of life. It is not a “belief” that
                marks off the Christian; he is distinguished by a different mode of
                action; he acts <i>differently</i>. He offers no resistance, either by word
                or in his heart, to those who stand against him. He draws no distinction
                between strangers and countrymen, Jews and Gentiles (“neighbour,” of
                course, means fellow-believer, Jew). He is angry with no one, and he
                despises no one. He neither appeals to the courts of justice nor heeds
                their mandates (“Swear not at all”).<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_12">[12]</a> He never under any
                circumstances divorces his wife, even when he has proofs of her
                infidelity.—And under all of this is one principle; all of it arises
                from one instinct.—</p>

                <p>The life of the Saviour was simply a carrying<span class="pagenum" title="Page 103"> </span><a id="Page_103"></a> out of this way of
                life—and so was his death.... He no longer needed any formula or ritual
                in his relations with God—not even prayer. He had rejected the whole of
                the Jewish doctrine of repentance and atonement; he <i>knew</i> that it was
                only by a <i>way</i> of life that one could feel one’s self “divine,”
                “blessed,” “evangelical,” a “child of God.” <i>Not</i> by “repentance,” <i>not</i>
                by “prayer and forgiveness” is the way to God: <i>only the Gospel way</i>
                leads to God—it is <i>itself</i> “God!”—What the Gospels <i>abolished</i> was
                the Judaism in the concepts of “sin,” “forgiveness of sin,” “faith,”
                “salvation through faith”—the whole <i>ecclesiastical</i> dogma of the Jews
                was denied by the “glad tidings.”</p>
                <p>The deep instinct which prompts the Christian how to <i>live</i> so that he
                will feel that he is “in heaven” and is “immortal,” despite many reasons
                for feeling that he is <i>not</i> “in heaven”: this is the only psychological
                reality in “salvation.”—A new way of life, <i>not</i> a new faith....</p>
                <h3>34.</h3>
                <p>If I understand anything at all about this great symbolist, it is this:
                that he regarded only <i>subjective</i> realities as realities, as
                “truths”<span class="pagenum" title="Page 104"> </span><a id="Page_104"></a>—that he saw everything else, everything natural, temporal,
                spatial and historical, merely as signs, as materials for parables. The
                concept of “the Son of God” does not connote a concrete person in
                history, an isolated and definite individual, but an “eternal” fact, a
                psychological symbol set free from the concept of time. The same thing
                is true, and in the highest sense, of the <i>God</i> of this typical
                symbolist, of the “kingdom of God,” and of the “sonship of God.” Nothing
                could be more un-Christian than the <i>crude ecclesiastical</i> notions of
                God as a <i>person</i>, of a “kingdom of God” that is to come, of a “kingdom
                of heaven” beyond, and of a “son of God” as the <i>second person</i> of the
                Trinity. All this—if I may be forgiven the phrase—is like thrusting
                one’s fist into the eye (and what an eye!) of the Gospels: a disrespect
                for symbols amounting to <i>world-historical cynicism</i>.... But it is
                nevertheless obvious enough what is meant by the symbols “Father” and
                “Son”—not, of course, to every one—: the word “Son” expresses
                <i>entrance</i> into the feeling that there is a general transformation of
                all things (beatitude), and “Father” expresses <i>that feeling
                itself</i>—the sensation of eternity and of perfection.—I am<span class="pagenum" title="Page 105"> </span><a id="Page_105"></a> ashamed to
                remind you of what the church has made of this symbolism: has it not set
                an Amphitryon story<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13_13">[13]</a> at the threshold of the Christian “faith”? And a
                dogma of “immaculate conception” for good measure?... <i>And thereby it
                has robbed conception of its immaculateness</i>—</p>

                Tiryns. His wife was Alcmene. During his absence she was visited by
                Zeus, and bore Heracles.</p></div>
                <p>The “kingdom of heaven” is a state of the heart—not something to come
                “beyond the world” or “after death.” The whole idea of natural death is
                <i>absent</i> from the Gospels: death is not a bridge, not a passing; it is
                absent because it belongs to a quite different, a merely apparent world,
                useful only as a symbol. The “hour of death” is <i>not</i> a Christian
                idea—“hours,” time, the physical life and its crises have no existence
                for the bearer of “glad tidings.”... The “kingdom of God” is not
                something that men wait for: it had no yesterday and no day after
                tomorrow, it is not going to come at a “millennium”—it is an experience
                of the heart, it is everywhere and it is nowhere....</p>

                <p>This “bearer of glad tidings” died as he lived and <i>taught</i>—<i>not</i> to
                “save mankind,” but to show mankind how to live. It was a <i>way of life</i>
                that he bequeathed to man: his demeanour before the judges, before the
                officers, before his accusers—his demeanour on the <i>cross</i>. He does not
                resist; he does not defend his rights; he makes no effort to ward off
                the most extreme penalty—more, <i>he invites it</i>.... And he prays,
                suffers and loves <i>with</i> those, <i>in</i> those, who do him evil.... <i>Not</i> to
                defend one’s self, <i>not</i> to show anger, <i>not</i> to lay blames.... On the
                contrary, to submit even to the Evil One—to <i>love</i> him....</p>
                <h3>36.</h3>
                <p>—We free spirits—we are the first to have the necessary prerequisite
                to understanding what nineteen centuries have misunderstood—that
                instinct and passion for integrity which makes war upon the “holy lie”
                even more than upon all other lies.... Mankind was unspeakably far from
                our benevolent and cautious neutrality, from that discipline of the
                spirit which alone<span class="pagenum" title="Page 107"> </span><a id="Page_107"></a> makes possible the solution of such strange and
                subtle things: what men always sought, with shameless egoism, was their
                <i>own</i> advantage therein; they created the <i>church</i> out of denial of the
                Gospels....</p>
                <p>Whoever sought for signs of an ironical divinity’s hand in the great
                drama of existence would find no small indication thereof in the
                <i>stupendous question-mark</i> that is called Christianity. That mankind
                should be on its knees before the very antithesis of what was the
                origin, the meaning and the <i>law</i> of the Gospels—that in the concept of
                the “church” the very things should be pronounced holy that the “bearer
                of glad tidings” regards as <i>beneath</i> him and <i>behind</i> him—it would be
                impossible to surpass this as a grand example of <i>world-historical
                irony</i>—</p>
                <h3>37.</h3>
                <p>—Our age is proud of its historical sense: how, then, could it delude
                itself into believing that the <i>crude fable of the wonder-worker and
                Saviour</i> constituted the beginnings of Christianity—and that everything
                spiritual and symbolical in it only came later? Quite to the contrary,
                the whole history of Christianity—from the<span class="pagenum" title="Page 108"> </span><a id="Page_108"></a> death on the cross
                onward—is the history of a progressively clumsier misunderstanding of
                an <i>original</i> symbolism. With every extension of Christianity among
                larger and ruder masses, even less capable of grasping the principles
                that gave birth to it, the need arose to make it more and more <i>vulgar</i>
                and <i>barbarous</i>—it absorbed the teachings and rites of all the
                <i>subterranean</i> cults of the <i>imperium Romanum</i>, and the absurdities
                engendered by all sorts of sickly reasoning. It was the fate of
                Christianity that its faith had to become as sickly, as low and as
                vulgar as the needs were sickly, low and vulgar to which it had to
                administer. A <i>sickly barbarism</i> finally lifts itself to power as the
                church—the church, that incarnation of deadly hostility to all honesty,
                to all loftiness of soul, to all discipline of the spirit, to all
                spontaneous and kindly humanity.—<i>Christian</i> values—<i>noble</i> values: it
                is only we, we <i>free</i> spirits, who have re-established this greatest of
                all antitheses in values!...</p>
                <h3>38.</h3>
                <p>—I cannot, at this place, avoid a sigh. There are days when I am
                visited by a feeling blacker than the blackest melancholy—<i>contempt of
                man</i>.<span class="pagenum" title="Page 109"> </span><a id="Page_109"></a> Let me leave no doubt as to <i>what</i> I despise, <i>whom</i> I despise:
                it is the man of today, the man with whom I am unhappily
                contemporaneous. The man of today—I am suffocated by his foul
                breath!... Toward the past, like all who understand, I am full of
                tolerance, which is to say, <i>generous</i> self-control: with gloomy caution
                I pass through whole millenniums of this madhouse of a world, call it
                “Christianity,” “Christian faith” or the “Christian church,” as you
                will—I take care not to hold mankind responsible for its lunacies. But
                my feeling changes and breaks out irresistibly the moment I enter modern
                times, <i>our</i> times. Our age <i>knows better</i>.... What was formerly merely
                sickly now becomes indecent—it is indecent to be a Christian today.
                <i>And here my disgust begins.</i>—I look about me: not a word survives of
                what was once called “truth”; we can no longer bear to hear a priest
                pronounce the word. Even a man who makes the most modest pretensions to
                integrity <i>must</i> know that a theologian, a priest, a pope of today not
                only errs when he speaks, but actually <i>lies</i>—and that he no longer
                escapes blame for his lie through “innocence” or “ignorance.” The priest
                knows,<span class="pagenum" title="Page 110"> </span><a id="Page_110"></a> as every one knows, that there is no longer any “God,” or any
                “sinner,” or any “Saviour”—that “free will” and the “moral order of the
                world” are lies—: serious reflection, the profound self-conquest of the
                spirit, <i>allow</i> no man to pretend that he does <i>not</i> know it.... <i>All</i>
                the ideas of the church are now recognized for what they are—as the
                worst counterfeits in existence, invented to debase nature and all
                natural values; the priest himself is seen as he actually is—as the
                most dangerous form of parasite, as the venomous spider of creation....
                We know, our <i>conscience</i> now knows—just <i>what</i> the real value of all
                those sinister inventions of priest and church has been and <i>what ends
                they have served</i>, with their debasement of humanity to a state of
                self-pollution, the very sight of which excites loathing,—the concepts
                “the other world,” “the last judgment,” “the immortality of the soul,”
                the “soul” itself: they are all merely so many instruments of torture,
                systems of cruelty, whereby the priest becomes master and remains
                master.... Every one knows this, <i>but nevertheless things remain as
                before</i>. What has become of the last trace of decent feeling, of
                self-respect, when our statesmen, otherwise an unconventional<span class="pagenum" title="Page 111"> </span><a id="Page_111"></a> class of
                men and thoroughly anti-Christian in their acts, now call themselves
                Christians and go to the communion-table?... A prince at the head of his
                armies, magnificent as the expression of the egoism and arrogance of his
                people—and yet acknowledging, <i>without</i> any shame, that he is a
                Christian!... Whom, then, does Christianity deny? <i>what</i> does it call
                “the world”? To be a <i>soldier</i>, to be a judge, to be a patriot; to
                defend one’s self; to be careful of one’s honour; to desire one’s own
                advantage; to be <i>proud</i> ... every act of everyday, every instinct,
                every valuation that shows itself in a <i>deed</i>, is now anti-Christian:
                what a <i>monster of falsehood</i> the modern man must be to call himself
                nevertheless, and <i>without</i> shame, a Christian!—</p>
                <h3>39.</h3>
                <p>—I shall go back a bit, and tell you the <i>authentic</i> history of
                Christianity.—The very word “Christianity” is a misunderstanding—at
                bottom there was only one Christian, and he died on the cross. The
                “Gospels” <i>died</i> on the cross. What, from that moment onward, was called
                the “Gospels” was the very reverse of<span class="pagenum" title="Page 112"> </span><a id="Page_112"></a> what <i>he</i> had lived: “bad
                tidings,” a <i>Dysangelium</i>.<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14_14">[14]</a> It is an error amounting to
                nonsensicality to see in “faith,” and particularly in faith in salvation
                through Christ, the distinguishing mark of the Christian: only the
                Christian <i>way of life</i>, the life <i>lived</i> by him who died on the cross,
                is Christian.... To this day <i>such</i> a life is still possible, and for
                <i>certain</i> men even necessary: genuine, primitive Christianity will
                remain possible in all ages.... <i>Not</i> faith, but acts; above all, an
                <i>avoidance</i> of acts, a different <i>state of being</i>.... States of
                consciousness, faith of a sort, the acceptance, for example, of anything
                as true—as every psychologist knows, the value of these things is
                perfectly indifferent and fifth-rate compared to that of the instincts:
                strictly speaking, the whole concept of intellectual causality is false.
                To reduce being a Christian, the state of Christianity, to an acceptance
                of truth, to a mere phenomenon of consciousness, is to formulate the
                negation of Christianity. <i>In fact, there are no Christians.</i> The
                “Christian”—he who for two thousand years has passed as a Christian—is
                simply a psycho<span class="pagenum" title="Page 113"> </span><a id="Page_113"></a>logical self-delusion. Closely examined, it appears
                that, <i>despite</i> all his “faith,” he has been ruled <i>only</i> by his
                instincts—and <i>what instincts</i>!—In all ages—for example, in the case
                of Luther—“faith” has been no more than a cloak, a pretense, a
                <i>curtain</i> behind which the instincts have played their game—a shrewd
                <i>blindness</i> to the domination of <i>certain</i> of the instincts.... I have
                already called “faith” the specially Christian form of
                <i>shrewdness</i>—people always <i>talk</i> of their “faith” and <i>act</i> according
                to their instincts.... In the world of ideas of the Christian there is
                nothing that so much as touches reality: on the contrary, one recognizes
                an instinctive <i>hatred</i> of reality as the motive power, the only motive
                power at the bottom of Christianity. What follows therefrom? That even
                here, in <i>psychologicis</i>, there is a radical error, which is to say one
                conditioning fundamentals, which is to say, one in <i>substance</i>. Take
                away one idea and put a genuine reality in its place—and the whole of
                Christianity crumbles to nothingness!—Viewed calmly, this strangest of
                all phenomena, a religion not only depending on errors, but inventive
                and ingenious <i>only</i> in devising injurious<span class="pagenum" title="Page 114"> </span><a id="Page_114"></a> errors, poisonous to life
                and to the heart—this remains a <i>spectacle for the gods</i>—for those
                gods who are also philosophers, and whom I have encountered, for
                example, in the celebrated dialogues at Naxos. At the moment when their
                <i>disgust</i> leaves them (—and us!) they will be thankful for the
                spectacle afforded by the Christians: perhaps because of <i>this</i> curious
                exhibition alone the wretched little planet called the earth deserves a
                glance from omnipotence, a show of divine interest.... Therefore, let us
                not underestimate the Christians: the Christian, false <i>to the point of
                innocence</i>, is far above the ape—in its application to the Christians a
                well-known theory of descent becomes a mere piece of politeness....</p>

                <p>—The fate of the Gospels was decided by death—it hung on the “cross.”... It was only death, that unexpected and shameful death; it was only
                the cross, which was usually reserved for the canaille only—it was only
                this appalling paradox which brought the disciples face to face with the
                real riddle: “<i>Who was it? what was it</i>?”—The feeling of dis<span class="pagenum" title="Page 115"> </span><a id="Page_115"></a>may, of
                profound affront and injury; the suspicion that such a death might
                involve a <i>refutation</i> of their cause; the terrible question, “Why just
                in this way?”—this state of mind is only too easy to understand. Here
                everything <i>must</i> be accounted for as necessary; everything must have a
                meaning, a reason, the highest sort of reason; the love of a disciple
                excludes all chance. Only then did the chasm of doubt yawn: “<i>Who</i> put
                him to death? who was his natural enemy?”—this question flashed like a
                lightning-stroke. Answer: dominant Judaism, its ruling class. From that
                moment, one found one’s self in revolt <i>against</i> the established order,
                and began to understand Jesus as <i>in revolt against the established
                order</i>. Until then this militant, this nay-saying, nay-doing element in
                his character had been lacking; what is more, he had appeared to present
                its opposite. Obviously, the little community had <i>not</i> understood what
                was precisely the most important thing of all: the example offered by
                this way of dying, the freedom from and superiority to every feeling of
                <i>ressentiment</i>—a plain indication of how little he was understood at
                all! All that Jesus could hope to accomplish by his death, in itself,
                was<span class="pagenum" title="Page 116"> </span><a id="Page_116"></a> to offer the strongest possible proof, or <i>example</i>, of his
                teachings in the most public manner.... But his disciples were very far
                from <i>forgiving</i> his death—though to have done so would have accorded
                with the Gospels in the highest degree; and neither were they prepared
                to <i>offer</i> themselves, with gentle and serene calmness of heart, for a
                similar death.... On the contrary, it was precisely the most
                unevangelical of feelings, <i>revenge</i>, that now possessed them. It seemed
                impossible that the cause should perish with his death: “recompense” and
                “judgment” became necessary (—yet what could be less evangelical than
                “recompense,” “punishment,” and “sitting in judgment”!). Once more the
                popular belief in the coming of a messiah appeared in the foreground;
                attention was rivetted upon an historical moment: the “kingdom of God”
                is to come, with judgment upon his enemies.... But in all this there was
                a wholesale misunderstanding: imagine the “kingdom of God” as a last
                act, as a mere promise! The Gospels had been, in fact, the incarnation,
                the fulfilment, the <i>realization</i> of this “kingdom of God.” It was only
                now that all the familiar contempt for and bitterness against Pharisees
                and theologians began to appear in<span class="pagenum" title="Page 117"> </span><a id="Page_117"></a> the character of the Master—he was
                thereby <i>turned</i> into a Pharisee and theologian himself! On the other
                hand, the savage veneration of these completely unbalanced souls could
                no longer endure the Gospel doctrine, taught by Jesus, of the equal
                right of all men to be children of God: their revenge took the form of
                <i>elevating</i> Jesus in an extravagant fashion, and thus separating him
                from themselves: just as, in earlier times, the Jews, to revenge
                themselves upon their enemies, separated themselves from their God, and
                placed him on a great height. The One God and the Only Son of God: both
                were products of <i>ressentiment</i>....</p>
                <h3>41.</h3>
                <p>—And from that time onward an absurd problem offered itself: “how
                <i>could</i> God allow it!” To which the deranged reason of the little
                community formulated an answer that was terrifying in its absurdity: God
                gave his son as a <i>sacrifice</i> for the forgiveness of sins. At once there
                was an end of the gospels! Sacrifice for sin, and in its most obnoxious
                and barbarous form: sacrifice of the <i>innocent</i> for the sins of the
                guilty! What appalling paganism!—Jesus him<span class="pagenum" title="Page 118"> </span><a id="Page_118"></a>self had done away with the
                very concept of “guilt,” he denied that there was any gulf fixed between
                God and man; he <i>lived</i> this unity between God and man, and that was
                precisely <i>his</i> “glad tidings”.... And <i>not</i> as a mere privilege!—From
                this time forward the type of the Saviour was corrupted, bit by bit, by
                the doctrine of judgment and of the second coming, the doctrine of death
                as a sacrifice, the doctrine of the <i>resurrection</i>, by means of which
                the entire concept of “blessedness,” the whole and only reality of the
                gospels, is juggled away—in favour of a state of existence <i>after</i>
                death!... St. Paul, with that rabbinical impudence which shows itself in
                all his doings, gave a logical quality to that conception, that
                <i>indecent</i> conception, in this way: “<i>If</i> Christ did not rise from the
                dead, then all our faith is in vain!”—And at once there sprang from the
                Gospels the most contemptible of all unfulfillable promises, the
                <i>shameless</i> doctrine of personal immortality.... Paul even preached it
                as a <i>reward</i>....</p>
                <h3>42.</h3>
                <p>One now begins to see just <i>what</i> it was that came to an end with the
                death on the cross: a<span class="pagenum" title="Page 119"> </span><a id="Page_119"></a> new and thoroughly original effort to found a
                Buddhistic peace movement, and so establish <i>happiness on earth</i>—real,
                <i>not</i> merely promised. For this remains—as I have already pointed
                out—the essential difference between the two religions of <i>décadence</i>:
                Buddhism promises nothing, but actually fulfils; Christianity promises
                everything, but <i>fulfils nothing</i>.—Hard upon the heels of the “glad
                tidings” came the worst imaginable: those of Paul. In Paul is incarnated
                the very opposite of the “bearer of glad tidings”; he represents the
                genius for hatred, the vision of hatred, the relentless logic of hatred.
                <i>What</i>, indeed, has not this dysangelist sacrificed to hatred! Above
                all, the Saviour: he nailed him to <i>his own</i> cross. The life, the
                example, the teaching, the death of Christ, the meaning and the law of
                the whole gospels—nothing was left of all this after that counterfeiter
                in hatred had reduced it to his uses. Surely <i>not</i> reality; surely <i>not</i>
                historical truth!... Once more the priestly instinct of the Jew
                perpetrated the same old master crime against history—he simply struck
                out the yesterday and the day before yesterday of Christianity, and
                <i>invented his own history of Christian beginnings</i>. Going<span class="pagenum" title="Page 120"> </span><a id="Page_120"></a> further, he
                treated the history of Israel to another falsification, so that it
                became a mere prologue to <i>his</i> achievement: all the prophets, it now
                appeared, had referred to <i>his</i> “Saviour.”... Later on the church even
                falsified the history of man in order to make it a prologue to
                Christianity.... The figure of the Saviour, his teaching, his way of
                life, his death, the meaning of his death, even the consequences of his
                death—nothing remained untouched, nothing remained in even remote
                contact with reality. Paul simply shifted the centre of gravity of that
                whole life to a place <i>behind</i> this existence—in the <i>lie</i> of the
                “risen” Jesus. At bottom, he had no use for the life of the
                Saviour—what he needed was the death on the cross, <i>and</i> something
                more. To see anything honest in such a man as Paul, whose home was at
                the centre of the Stoical enlightenment, when he converts an
                hallucination into a <i>proof</i> of the resurrection of the Saviour, or even
                to believe his tale that he suffered from this hallucination
                himself—this would be a genuine <i>niaiserie</i> in a psychologist. Paul
                willed the end; <i>therefore</i> he also willed the means.... What he himself
                didn’t believe was swallowed readily enough by the idiots among whom he<span class="pagenum" title="Page 121"> </span><a id="Page_121"></a>
                spread <i>his</i> teaching.—What <i>he</i> wanted was power; in Paul the priest
                once more reached out for power—he had use only for such concepts,
                teachings and symbols as served the purpose of tyrannizing over the
                masses and organizing mobs. <i>What</i> was the only part of Christianity
                that Mohammed borrowed later on? Paul’s invention, his device for
                establishing priestly tyranny and organizing the mob: the belief in the
                immortality of the soul—<i>that is to say, the doctrine of
                “judgment”</i>....</p>
                <h3>43.</h3>
                <p>When the centre of gravity of life is placed, <i>not</i> in life itself, but
                in “the beyond”—in <i>nothingness</i>—then one has taken away its centre of
                gravity altogether. The vast lie of personal immortality destroys all
                reason, all natural instinct—henceforth, everything in the instincts
                that is beneficial, that fosters life and that safeguards the future is
                a cause of suspicion. So to live that life no longer has any meaning:
                <i>this</i> is now the “meaning” of life.... Why be public-spirited? Why take
                any pride in descent and forefathers? Why labour together, trust one
                another, or concern<span class="pagenum" title="Page 122"> </span><a id="Page_122"></a> one’s self about the common welfare, and try to
                serve it?... Merely so many “temptations,” so many strayings from the
                “straight path.”—“<i>One</i> thing only is necessary”.... That every man,
                because he has an “immortal soul,” is as good as every other man; that
                in an infinite universe of things the “salvation” of <i>every</i> individual
                may lay claim to eternal importance; that insignificant bigots and the
                three-fourths insane may assume that the laws of nature are constantly
                <i>suspended</i> in their behalf—it is impossible to lavish too much
                contempt upon such a magnification of every sort of selfishness to
                infinity, to <i>insolence</i>. And yet Christianity has to thank precisely
                <i>this</i> miserable flattery of personal vanity for its <i>triumph</i>—it was
                thus that it lured all the botched, the dissatisfied, the fallen upon
                evil days, the whole refuse and off-scouring of humanity to its side.
                The “salvation of the soul”—in plain English: “the world revolves
                around <i>me</i>.”... The poisonous doctrine, “<i>equal</i> rights for all,” has
                been propagated as a Christian principle: out of the secret nooks and
                crannies of bad instinct Christianity has waged a deadly war upon all
                feelings of reverence and distance between man and man,<span class="pagenum" title="Page 123"> </span><a id="Page_123"></a> which is to
                say, upon the first <i>prerequisite</i> to every step upward, to every
                development of civilization—out of the <i>ressentiment</i> of the masses it
                has forged its chief weapons against <i>us</i>, against everything noble,
                joyous and high-spirited on earth, against our happiness on earth.... To
                allow “immortality” to every Peter and Paul was the greatest, the most
                vicious outrage upon <i>noble</i> humanity ever perpetrated.—<i>And</i> let us
                not underestimate the fatal influence that Christianity has had, even
                upon politics! Nowadays no one has courage any more for special rights,
                for the right of dominion, for feelings of honourable pride in himself
                and his equals—for the <i>pathos of distance</i>.... Our politics is sick
                with this lack of courage!—The aristocratic attitude of mind has been
                undermined by the lie of the equality of souls; and if belief in the
                “privileges of the majority” makes and <i>will continue to make</i>
                revolutions—it is Christianity, let us not doubt, and <i>Christian</i>
                valuations, which convert every revolution into a carnival of blood and
                crime! Christianity is a revolt of all creatures that creep on the
                ground against everything that is <i>lofty</i>: the gospel of the “lowly”
                <i>lowers</i>....</p>
                <h3><span class="pagenum" title="Page 124"> </span><a id="Page_124"></a>44.</h3>
                <p>—The gospels are invaluable as evidence of the corruption that was
                already persistent <i>within</i> the primitive community. That which Paul,
                with the cynical logic of a rabbi, later developed to a conclusion was
                at bottom merely a process of decay that had begun with the death of the
                Saviour.—These gospels cannot be read too carefully; difficulties lurk
                behind every word. I confess—I hope it will not be held against
                me—that it is precisely for this reason that they offer first-rate joy
                to a psychologist—as the <i>opposite</i> of all merely naïve corruption, as
                refinement <i>par excellence</i>, as an artistic triumph in psychological
                corruption. The gospels, in fact, stand alone. The Bible as a whole is
                not to be compared to them. Here we are among Jews: this is the <i>first</i>
                thing to be borne in mind if we are not to lose the thread of the
                matter. This positive genius for conjuring up a delusion of personal
                “holiness” unmatched anywhere else, either in books or by men; this
                elevation of fraud in word and attitude to the level of an <i>art</i>—all
                this is not an accident due to the chance talents of an individual, or
                to any violation of nature.<span class="pagenum" title="Page 125"> </span><a id="Page_125"></a> The thing responsible is <i>race</i>. The whole
                of Judaism appears in Christianity as the art of concocting holy lies,
                and there, after many centuries of earnest Jewish training and hard
                practice of Jewish technic, the business comes to the stage of mastery.
                The Christian, that <i>ultima ratio</i> of lying, is the Jew all over
                again—he is <i>threefold</i> the Jew.... The underlying will to make use
                only of such concepts, symbols and attitudes as fit into priestly
                practice, the instinctive repudiation of every <i>other</i> mode of thought,
                and every other method of estimating values and utilities—this is not
                only tradition, it is <i>inheritance</i>: only as an inheritance is it able
                to operate with the force of nature. The whole of mankind, even the best
                minds of the best ages (with one exception, perhaps hardly human—),
                have permitted themselves to be deceived. The gospels have been read as
                a <i>book of innocence</i> ... surely no small indication of the high skill
                with which the trick has been done.—Of course, if we could actually
                <i>see</i> these astounding bigots and bogus saints, even if only for an
                instant, the farce would come to an end,—and it is precisely because
                <i>I</i> cannot read a word of theirs without seeing their attitudinizing<span class="pagenum" title="Page 126"> </span><a id="Page_126"></a>
                that <i>I have made an end of them</i>.... I simply cannot endure the way
                they have of rolling up their eyes.—For the majority, happily enough,
                books are mere <i>literature</i>.—Let us not be led astray: they say “judge
                not,” and yet they condemn to hell whoever stands in their way. In
                letting God sit in judgment they judge themselves; in glorifying God
                they glorify themselves; in <i>demanding</i> that every one show the virtues
                which they themselves happen to be capable of—still more, which they
                <i>must</i> have in order to remain on top—they assume the grand air of men
                struggling for virtue, of men engaging in a war that virtue may prevail.
                “We live, we die, we sacrifice ourselves <i>for the good</i>” (—“the truth,”
                “the light,” “the kingdom of God”): in point of fact, they simply do
                what they cannot help doing. Forced, like hypocrites, to be sneaky, to
                hide in corners, to slink along in the shadows, they convert their
                necessity into a <i>duty</i>: it is on grounds of duty that they account for
                their lives of humility, and that humility becomes merely one more proof
                of their piety.... Ah, that humble, chaste, charitable brand of fraud!
                “Virtue itself shall bear witness for us.”... One may read the gospels<span class="pagenum" title="Page 127"> </span><a id="Page_127"></a>
                as books of <i>moral</i> seduction: these petty folks fasten themselves to
                morality—they know the uses of morality! Morality is the best of all
                devices for leading mankind <i>by the nose</i>!—The fact is that the
                conscious conceit of the chosen here disguises itself as modesty: it is
                in this way that <i>they</i>, the “community,” the “good and just,” range
                themselves, once and for always, on one side, the side of “the
                truth”—and the rest of mankind, “the world,” on the other.... In <i>that</i>
                we observe the most fatal sort of megalomania that the earth has ever
                seen: little abortions of bigots and liars began to claim exclusive
                rights in the concepts of “God,” “the truth,” “the light,” “the spirit,”
                “love,” “wisdom” and “life,” as if these things were synonyms of
                themselves and thereby they sought to fence themselves off from the
                “world”; little super-Jews, ripe for some sort of madhouse, turned
                values upside down in order to meet <i>their</i> notions, just as if the
                Christian were the meaning, the salt, the standard and even the <i>last
                judgment</i> of all the rest.... The whole disaster was only made possible
                by the fact that there already existed in the world a similar
                megalomania, allied to this one in race, to wit, the <i>Jewish</i>: once a
                chasm<span class="pagenum" title="Page 128"> </span><a id="Page_128"></a> began to yawn between Jews and Judaeo-Christians, the latter had
                no choice but to employ the self-preservative measures that the Jewish
                instinct had devised, even <i>against</i> the Jews themselves, whereas the
                Jews had employed them only against non-Jews. The Christian is simply a
                Jew of the “reformed” confession.—</p>

                <h3>46.</h3>
                <p>—<i>What follows, then?</i> That one had better put on gloves before reading
                the New Testament. The presence of so much filth makes it very
                advisable. One would as little choose “early Christians” for companions
                as Polish Jews: not that one need seek out an objection to them....
                Neither has a pleasant smell.—I have searched the New Testament in vain
                for a single sympathetic touch; nothing is there that is free, kindly,
                open-hearted or upright. In it humanity does not even make the first
                step upward—the instinct for <i>cleanliness</i> is lacking.... Only <i>evil</i>
                instincts are there, and there is not even the courage of these evil
                instincts. It is all coward<span class="pagenum" title="Page 133"> </span><a id="Page_133"></a>ice; it is all a shutting of the eyes, a
                self-deception. Every other book becomes clean, once one has read the
                New Testament: for example, immediately after reading Paul I took up
                with delight that most charming and wanton of scoffers, Petronius, of
                whom one may say what Domenico Boccaccio wrote of Cæsar Borgia to the
                Duke of Parma: “<i>è tutto festo</i>”—immortally healthy, immortally
                cheerful and sound.... These petty bigots make a capital miscalculation.
                They attack, but everything they attack is thereby <i>distinguished</i>.
                Whoever is attacked by an “early Christian” is surely <i>not</i> befouled....
                On the contrary, it is an honour to have an “early Christian” as an
                opponent. One cannot read the New Testament without acquired admiration
                for whatever it abuses—not to speak of the “wisdom of this world,”
                which an impudent wind-bag tries to dispose of “by the foolishness of
                preaching.”... Even the scribes and pharisees are benefitted by such
                opposition: they must certainly have been worth something to have been
                hated in such an indecent manner. Hypocrisy—as if this were a charge
                that the “early Christians” <i>dared</i> to make!—After all, they were the
                <i>privileged</i>, and that was enough: the hatred<span class="pagenum" title="Page 134"> </span><a id="Page_134"></a> of the Chandala needed no
                other excuse. The “early Christian”—and also, I fear, the “last
                Christian,” <i>whom I may perhaps live to see</i>—is a rebel against all
                privilege by profound instinct—he lives and makes war for ever for
                “equal rights.”... Strictly speaking, he has no alternative. When a man
                proposes to represent, in his own person, the “chosen of God”—or to be
                a “temple of God,” or a “judge of the angels”—then every <i>other</i>
                criterion, whether based upon honesty, upon intellect, upon manliness
                and pride, or upon beauty and freedom of the heart, becomes simply
                “worldly”—<i>evil in itself</i>.... Moral: every word that comes from the
                lips of an “early Christian” is a lie, and his every act is
                instinctively dishonest—all his values, all his aims are noxious, but
                <i>whoever</i> he hates, <i>whatever</i> he hates, has real <i>value</i>.... The
                Christian, and particularly the Christian priest, is thus a <i>criterion
                of values</i>.</p>
                <p>—Must I add that, in the whole New Testament, there appears but a
                <i>solitary</i> figure worthy of honour? Pilate, the Roman viceroy. To regard
                a Jewish imbroglio <i>seriously</i>—that was quite beyond him. One Jew more
                or less—what did it matter?... The noble scorn of a<span class="pagenum" title="Page 135"> </span><a id="Page_135"></a> Roman, before whom
                the word “truth” was shamelessly mishandled, enriched the New Testament
                with the only saying <i>that has any value</i>—and that is at once its
                criticism and its <i>destruction</i>: “What is truth?...<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original omitted the closing quotation mark.">”</ins></p>
                <h3>47.</h3>
                <p>—The thing that sets us apart is not that we are unable to find God,
                either in history, or in nature, or behind nature—but that we regard
                what has been honoured as God, not as “divine,” but as pitiable, as
                absurd, as injurious; not as a mere error, but as a <i>crime against
                life</i>.... We deny that God is God.... If any one were to <i>show</i> us this
                Christian God, we’d be still less inclined to believe in him.—In a
                formula: <i>deus, qualem Paulus creavit, dei negatio</i>.—Such a religion as
                Christianity, which does not touch reality at a single point and which
                goes to pieces the moment reality asserts its rights at any point, must
                be inevitably the deadly enemy of the “wisdom of this world,” which is
                to say, of <i>science</i>—and it will give the name of good to whatever
                means serve to poison, calumniate and <i>cry down</i> all intellectual
                discipline, all lucidity and strictness in matters of intellectual
                conscience, and<span class="pagenum" title="Page 136"> </span><a id="Page_136"></a> all noble coolness and freedom of the mind. “Faith,” as
                an imperative, vetoes science—<i>in praxi</i>, lying at any price.... Paul
                <i>well knew</i> that lying—that “faith”—was necessary; later on the church
                borrowed the fact from Paul.—The God that Paul invented for himself, a
                God who “reduced to absurdity” “the wisdom of this world” (especially
                the two great enemies of superstition, philology and medicine), is in
                truth only an indication of Paul’s resolute <i>determination</i> to
                accomplish that very thing himself: to give one’s own will the name of
                God, <i>thora</i>—that is essentially Jewish. Paul <i>wants</i> to dispose of the
                “wisdom of this world”: his enemies are the <i>good</i> philologians and
                physicians of the Alexandrine school—on them he makes his war. As a
                matter of fact no man can be a <i>philologian</i> or a physician without
                being also <i>Antichrist</i>. That is to say, as a philologian a man sees
                <i>behind</i> the “holy books,” and as a physician he sees <i>behind</i> the
                physiological degeneration of the typical Christian. The physician says
                “incurable”; the philologian says “fraud.”...</p>
                <h3><span class="pagenum" title="Page 137"> </span><a id="Page_137"></a>48.</h3>
                <p>—Has any one ever clearly understood the celebrated story at the
                beginning of the Bible—of God’s mortal terror of <i>science</i>?... No one,
                in fact, has understood it. This priest-book <i>par excellence</i> opens, as
                is fitting, with the great inner difficulty of the priest: <i>he</i> faces
                only one great danger; <i>ergo</i>, “God” faces only one great danger.—</p>
                <p>The old God, wholly “spirit,” wholly the high-priest, wholly perfect, is
                promenading his garden: he is bored and trying to kill time. Against
                boredom even gods struggle in vain.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21_21">[21]</a> What does he do? He creates
                man—man is entertaining.... But then he notices that man is also bored.
                God’s pity for the only form of distress that invades all paradises
                knows no bounds: so he forthwith creates other animals. God’s first
                mistake: to man these other animals were not entertaining—he sought
                dominion over them; he did not want to be an “animal” himself.—So God
                created woman. In the act he brought boredom to an end—and also many<span class="pagenum" title="Page 138"> </span><a id="Page_138"></a>
                other things! Woman was the <i>second</i> mistake of God.—“Woman, at bottom,
                is a serpent, Heva”—every priest knows that; “from woman comes every
                evil in the world”—every priest knows that, too. <i>Ergo</i>, she is also to
                blame for <i>science</i>.... It was through woman that man learned to taste
                of the tree of knowledge.—What happened? The old God was seized by
                mortal terror. Man himself had been his <i>greatest</i> blunder; he had
                created a rival to himself; science makes men <i>godlike</i>—it is all up
                with priests and gods when man becomes scientific!—<i>Moral</i>: science is
                the forbidden <i>per se</i>; it alone is forbidden. Science is the <i>first</i> of
                sins, the germ of all sins, the <i>original</i> sin. <i>This is all there is of
                morality.</i>—“Thou shall <i>not</i> know”:—the rest follows from that.—God’s
                mortal terror, however, did not hinder him from being shrewd. How is one
                to <i>protect</i> one’s self against science? For a long while this was the
                capital problem. Answer: Out of paradise with man! Happiness, leisure,
                foster thought—and all thoughts are bad thoughts!—Man <i>must</i> not
                think.—And so the priest invents distress, death, the mortal dangers of
                childbirth, all sorts of misery, old age, decrepitude, above all,
                <i>sickness</i>—nothing<span class="pagenum" title="Page 139"> </span><a id="Page_139"></a> but devices for making war on science! The troubles
                of man don’t <i>allow</i> him to think.... Nevertheless—how terrible!—, the
                edifice of knowledge begins to tower aloft, invading heaven, shadowing
                the gods—what is to be done?—The old God invents <i>war</i>; he separates
                the peoples; he makes men destroy one another (—the priests have always
                had need of war....). War—among other things, a great disturber of
                science!—Incredible! Knowledge, <i>deliverance from the priests</i>,
                prospers in spite of war.—So the old God comes to his final resolution:
                “Man has become scientific—<i>there is no help for it: he must be
                drowned!</i>”...</p>

                <p>—I have been understood. At the opening of the Bible there is the
                <i>whole</i> psychology of the priest.—The priest knows of only one great
                danger: that is science—the sound comprehension of cause and effect.
                But science flourishes, on the whole, only under favourable
                conditions—a man must have time, he must have an <i>overflowing</i>
                intellect, in order to “know.”... “<i>Therefore</i>, man must be made
                unhappy,”—this has been, in all ages, the logic of the priest.—It is<span class="pagenum" title="Page 140"> </span><a id="Page_140"></a>
                easy to see just <i>what</i>, by this logic, was the first thing to come into
                the world:—“<i>sin</i>.”... The concept of guilt and punishment, the whole
                “moral order of the world,” was set up <i>against</i> science—<i>against</i> the
                deliverance of man from priests.... Man must <i>not</i> look outward; he must
                look inward. He must <i>not</i> look at things shrewdly and cautiously, to
                learn about them; he must not look at all; he must <i>suffer</i>.... And he
                must suffer so much that he is always in need of the priest.—Away with
                physicians! <i>What is needed is a Saviour.</i>—The concept of guilt and
                punishment, including the doctrines of “grace,” of “salvation,” of
                “forgiveness”—<i>lies</i> through and through, and absolutely without
                psychological reality—were devised to destroy man’s <i>sense of
                causality</i>: they are an attack upon the concept of cause and
                effect!—And <i>not</i> an attack with the fist, with the knife, with honesty
                in hate and love! On the contrary, one inspired by the most cowardly,
                the most crafty, the most ignoble of instincts! An attack of <i>priests</i>!
                An attack of <i>parasites</i>! The vampirism of pale, subterranean
                leeches!... When the natural consequences of an act are no longer
                “natural,” but are regarded as produced by the ghostly<span class="pagenum" title="Page 141"> </span><a id="Page_141"></a> creations of
                superstition—by “God,” by “spirits,” by “souls”—and reckoned as merely
                “moral” consequences, as rewards, as punishments, as hints, as lessons,
                then the whole ground-work of knowledge is destroyed—<i>then the greatest
                of crimes against humanity has been perpetrated</i>.—I repeat that sin,
                man’s self-desecration <i>par excellence</i>, was invented in order to make
                science, culture, and every elevation and ennobling of man impossible;
                the priest <i>rules</i> through the invention of sin.—</p>
                <h3>50.</h3>
                <p>—In this place I can’t permit myself to omit a psychology of “belief,”
                of the “believer,” for the special benefit of “believers.” If there
                remain any today who do not yet know how <i>indecent</i> it is to be
                “believing”—<i>or</i> how much a sign of <i>décadence</i>, of a broken will to
                live—then they will know it well enough tomorrow. My voice reaches even
                the deaf.—It appears, unless I have been incorrectly informed, that
                there prevails among Christians a sort of criterion of truth that is
                called “proof by power.” “Faith makes blessed: <i>therefore</i> it is
                true.”—It might be objected right here that blessedness is not
                dem<span class="pagenum" title="Page 142"> </span><a id="Page_142"></a>onstrated, it is merely <i>promised</i>: it hangs upon “faith” as a
                condition—one <i>shall</i> be blessed <i>because</i> one believes.... But what of
                the thing that the priest promises to the believer, the wholly
                transcendental “beyond”—how is <i>that</i> to be demonstrated?—The “proof
                by power,” thus assumed, is actually no more at bottom than a belief
                that the effects which faith promises will not fail to appear. In a
                formula: “I believe that faith makes for blessedness—<i>therefore</i>, it is
                true.”... But this is as far as we may go. This “therefore” would be
                <i>absurdum</i> itself as a criterion of truth.—But let us admit, for the
                sake of politeness, that blessedness by faith may be demonstrated
                (—<i>not</i> merely hoped for, and <i>not</i> merely promised by the suspicious
                lips of a priest): even so, <i>could</i> blessedness—in a technical term,
                <i>pleasure</i>—ever be a proof of truth? So little is this true that it is
                almost a proof against truth when sensations of pleasure influence the
                answer to the question “What is true?” or, at all events, it is enough
                to make that “truth” highly suspicious. The proof by “pleasure” is a
                proof <i>of</i> “pleasure”—nothing more; why in the world should it be
                assumed that <i>true</i> judgments give more pleasure than false ones, and<span class="pagenum" title="Page 143"> </span><a id="Page_143"></a>
                that, in conformity to some pre-established harmony, they necessarily
                bring agreeable feelings in their train?—The experience of all
                disciplined and profound minds teaches <i>the contrary</i>. Man has had to
                fight for every atom of the truth, and has had to pay for it almost
                everything that the heart, that human love, that human trust cling to.
                Greatness of soul is needed for this business: the service of truth is
                the hardest of all services.—What, then, is the meaning of <i>integrity</i>
                in things intellectual? It means that a man must be severe with his own
                heart, that he must scorn “beautiful feelings,” and that he makes every
                Yea and Nay a matter of conscience!—Faith makes blessed: <i>therefore</i>,
                it lies....</p>
                <h3>51.</h3>
                <p>The fact that faith, under certain circumstances, may work for
                blessedness, but that this blessedness produced by an <i>idée fixe</i> by no
                means makes the idea itself true, and the fact that faith actually moves
                no mountains, but instead <i>raises them up</i> where there were none before:
                all this is made sufficiently clear by a walk through a <i>lunatic
                asylum</i>. <i>Not</i>, of course, to a priest: for his instincts prompt him to
                the lie that sickness<span class="pagenum" title="Page 144"> </span><a id="Page_144"></a> is not sickness and lunatic asylums not lunatic
                asylums. Christianity finds sickness <i>necessary</i>, just as the Greek
                spirit had need of a superabundance of health—the actual ulterior
                purpose of the whole system of salvation of the church is to <i>make</i>
                people ill. And the church itself—doesn’t it set up a Catholic lunatic
                asylum as the ultimate ideal?—The whole earth as a madhouse?—The sort
                of religious man that the church <i>wants</i> is a typical <i>décadent</i>; the
                moment at which a religious crisis dominates a people is always marked
                by epidemics of nervous disorder; the “inner world” of the religious man
                is so much like the “inner world” of the overstrung and exhausted that
                it is difficult to distinguish between them; the “highest” states of
                mind, held up before mankind by Christianity as of supreme worth, are
                actually epileptoid in form—the church has granted the name of holy
                only to lunatics or to gigantic frauds <i>in majorem dei honorem</i>.... Once
                I ventured to designate the whole Christian system of <i>training</i><a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22_22">[22]</a> in
                penance and salvation (now best studied in England) as a method of
                producing a <i>folie circulaire</i> upon a soil already prepared for it,
                which is to say, a soil thoroughly unhealthy. Not every one may<span class="pagenum" title="Page 145"> </span><a id="Page_145"></a> be a
                Christian<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original had a full-stop here rather than a colon.">:</ins> one is not “converted” to Christianity—one must first
                be sick enough for it.... We others, who have the <i>courage</i> for health
                <i>and</i> likewise for contempt,—we may well despise a religion that
                teaches misunderstanding of the body! that refuses to rid itself of the
                superstition about the soul! that makes a “virtue” of insufficient
                nourishment! that combats health as a sort of enemy, devil, temptation!
                that persuades itself that it is possible to carry about a “perfect
                soul” in a cadaver of a body, and that, to this end, had to devise for
                itself a new concept of “perfection,” a pale, sickly, idiotically
                ecstatic state of existence, so-called “holiness”—a holiness that is
                itself merely a series of symptoms of an impoverished, enervated and
                incurably disordered body!... The Christian movement, as a European
                movement, was from the start no more than a general uprising of all
                sorts of outcast and refuse elements (—who now, under cover of
                Christianity, aspire to power). It does <i>not</i> represent the decay of a
                race; it represents, on the contrary, a conglomeration of <i>décadence</i>
                products from all directions, crowding together and seeking one another
                out. It was <i>not</i>, as has been thought, the corruption of antiquity, of
                <i>noble</i> antiquity, which made<span class="pagenum" title="Page 146"> </span><a id="Page_146"></a> Christianity possible; one cannot too
                sharply challenge the learned imbecility which today maintains that
                theory. At the time when the sick and rotten Chandala classes in the
                whole <i>imperium</i> were Christianized, the <i>contrary type</i>, the nobility,
                reached its finest and ripest development. The majority became master;
                democracy, with its Christian instincts, <i>triumphed</i>.... Christianity
                was not “national,” it was not based on race—it appealed to all the
                varieties of men disinherited by life, it had its allies everywhere.
                Christianity has the rancour of the sick at its very core—the instinct
                against the <i>healthy</i>, against <i>health</i>. Everything that is
                well-constituted, proud, gallant and, above all, beautiful gives offence
                to its ears and eyes. Again I remind you of Paul’s priceless saying:
                “And God hath chosen the <i>weak</i> things of the world, the <i>foolish</i>
                things of the world, the <i>base</i> things of the world, and things which
                are <i>despised</i>”:<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23_23">[23]</a> <i>this</i> was the formula; <i>in hoc signo</i> the
                <i>décadence</i> triumphed.—<i>God on the cross</i>—is man always to miss the
                frightful inner significance of this symbol?—Everything that suffers,
                everything that hangs on the cross, is <i>divine</i>.... We all<span class="pagenum" title="Page 147"> </span><a id="Page_147"></a> hang on the
                cross, consequently <i>we</i> are divine.... We alone are divine....
                Christianity was thus a victory: a nobler attitude of mind was destroyed
                by it—Christianity remains to this day the greatest misfortune of
                humanity.—</p>

                <h3>52.</h3>
                <p>Christianity also stands in opposition to all <i>intellectual</i>
                well-being,—sick reasoning is the only sort that it <i>can</i> use as
                Christian reasoning; it takes the side of everything that is idiotic; it
                pronounces a curse upon “intellect,” upon the <i>superbia</i> of the healthy
                intellect. Since sickness is inherent in Christianity, it follows that
                the typically Christian state of “faith” <i>must</i> be a form of sickness
                too, and that all straight, straightforward and scientific paths to
                knowledge <i>must</i> be banned by the church as <i>forbidden</i> ways. Doubt is
                thus a sin from the start.... The complete lack of psychological
                cleanliness in the priest—revealed by a glance at him—is a phenomenon
                <i>resulting</i> from <i>décadence</i>,—one may observe in hysterical women and
                in rachitic children how regularly the falsification of instincts,
                delight in lying for the mere sake of lying, and incapacity for looking
                straight and walking<span class="pagenum" title="Page 148"> </span><a id="Page_148"></a> straight are symptoms of <i>décadence</i>. “Faith”
                means the will to avoid knowing what is true. The pietist, the priest of
                either sex, is a fraud <i>because</i> he is sick: his instinct <i>demands</i> that
                the truth shall never be allowed its rights on any point. “Whatever
                makes for illness is <i>good</i>; whatever issues from abundance, from
                superabundance, from power, is <i>evil</i>”: so argues the believer. The
                <i>impulse to lie</i>—it is by this that I recognize every foreordained
                theologian.—Another characteristic of the theologian is his <i>unfitness
                for philology</i>. What I here mean by philology is, in a general sense,
                the art of reading with profit—the capacity for absorbing facts
                <i>without</i> interpreting them falsely, and <i>without</i> losing caution,
                patience and subtlety in the effort to understand them. Philology as
                <i>ephexis</i><a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24_24">[24]</a> in interpretation: whether one be dealing with books, with
                newspaper reports, with the most fateful events or with weather
                statistics—not to mention the “salvation of the soul.”... The way in
                which a theologian, whether in Berlin or in Rome, is ready to explain,
                say, a “passage of Scripture,” or an experience, or a victory by<span class="pagenum" title="Page 149"> </span><a id="Page_149"></a> the
                national army, by turning upon it the high illumination of the Psalms of
                David, is always so <i>daring</i> that it is enough to make a philologian run
                up a wall. But what shall he do when pietists and other such cows from
                Suabia<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25_25">[25]</a> use the “finger of God” to convert their miserably
                commonplace and huggermugger existence into a miracle of “grace,” a
                “providence” and an “experience of salvation”? The most modest exercise
                of the intellect, not to say of decency, should certainly be enough to
                convince these interpreters of the perfect childishness and unworthiness
                of such a misuse of the divine digital dexterity. However small our
                piety, if we ever encountered a god who always cured us of a cold in the
                head at just the right time, or got us into our carriage at the very
                instant heavy rain began to fall, he would seem so absurd a god that
                he’d have to be abolished even if he existed. God as a domestic servant,
                as a letter carrier, as an almanac-man—at bottom, he is a mere name for
                the stupidest sort of chance.... “Divine Prov<span class="pagenum" title="Page 150"> </span><a id="Page_150"></a>idence,” which every third
                man in “educated Germany” still believes in, is so strong an argument
                against God that it would be impossible to think of a stronger. And in
                any case it is an argument against Germans!...</p>

                <h3>53.</h3>
                <p>—It is so little true that <i>martyrs</i> offer any support to the truth of
                a cause that I am inclined to deny that any martyr has ever had anything
                to do with the truth at all. In the very tone in which a martyr flings
                what he fancies to be true at the head of the world there appears so low
                a grade of intellectual honesty and such <i>insensibility</i> to the problem
                of “truth,” that it is never necessary to refute him. Truth is not
                something that one man has and another man has not: at best, only
                peasants, or peasant-apostles like Luther, can think of truth in any
                such way. One may rest assured that the greater the degree of a man’s
                intellectual conscience the greater will be his modesty, his
                <i>discretion</i>, on this point. To <i>know</i> in five cases, and to refuse,
                with delicacy, to know anything <i>further</i>.... “Truth,” as the word is
                understood by every prophet, every sectarian, every free-thinker, every
                Socialist and every churchman, is simply a complete proof<span class="pagenum" title="Page 151"> </span><a id="Page_151"></a> that not even
                a beginning has been made in the intellectual discipline and
                self-control that are necessary to the unearthing of even the smallest
                truth.—The deaths of the martyrs, it may be said in passing, have been
                misfortunes of history: they have <i>misled</i>.... The conclusion that all
                idiots, women and plebeians come to, that there must be something in a
                cause for which any one goes to his death (or which, as under primitive
                Christianity, sets off epidemics of death-seeking)—this conclusion has
                been an unspeakable drag upon the testing of facts, upon the whole
                spirit of inquiry and investigation. The martyrs have <i>damaged</i> the
                truth.... Even to this day the crude fact of persecution is enough to
                give an honourable name to the most empty sort of sectarianism.—But
                why? Is the worth of a cause altered by the fact that some one had laid
                down his life for it?—An error that becomes honourable is simply an
                error that has acquired one seductive charm the more: do you suppose,
                Messrs. Theologians, that we shall give you the chance to be martyred
                for your lies?—One best disposes of a cause by respectfully putting it
                on ice—that is also the best way to dispose of theologians.... This was
                precisely the world-<span class="pagenum" title="Page 152"> </span><a id="Page_152"></a>historical stupidity of all the persecutors: that
                they gave the appearance of honour to the cause they opposed—that they
                made it a present of the fascination of martyrdom.... Women are still on
                their knees before an error because they have been told that some one
                died on the cross for it. <i>Is the cross, then, an argument?</i>—But about
                all these things there is one, and one only, who has said what has been
                needed for thousands of years—<i>Zarathustra</i>.</p>
                <blockquote><div><p>They made signs in blood along the way that they went, and their folly
                taught them that the truth is proved by blood.</p>
                <p>But blood is the worst of all testimonies to the truth; blood poisoneth
                even the purest teaching and turneth it into madness and hatred in the
                heart.</p>

                <p>Do not let yourself be deceived: great intellects are sceptical.
                Zarathustra is a sceptic. The strength, the <i>freedom</i> which proceed from
                intellectual power, from a superabundance of intellectual power,
                <i>manifest</i> themselves as scep<span class="pagenum" title="Page 153"> </span><a id="Page_153"></a>ticism. Men of fixed convictions do not
                count when it comes to determining what is fundamental in values and
                lack of values. Men of convictions are prisoners. They do not see far
                enough, they do not see what is <i>below</i> them: whereas a man who would
                talk to any purpose about value and non-value must be able to see five
                hundred convictions <i>beneath</i> him—and <i>behind</i> him.... A mind that
                aspires to great things, and that wills the means thereto, is
                necessarily sceptical. Freedom from any sort of conviction <i>belongs</i> to
                strength, and to an independent point of view.... That grand passion
                which is at once the foundation and the power of a sceptic’s existence,
                and is both more enlightened and more despotic than he is himself,
                drafts the whole of his intellect into its service; it makes him
                unscrupulous; it gives him courage to employ unholy means; under certain
                circumstances it does not <i>begrudge</i> him even convictions. Conviction as
                a means: one may achieve a good deal by means of a conviction. A grand
                passion makes use of and uses up convictions; it does not yield to
                them—it knows itself to be sovereign.—On the contrary, the need of
                faith, of something unconditioned by yea or nay, of Carlylism,<span class="pagenum" title="Page 154"> </span><a id="Page_154"></a> if I may
                be allowed the word, is a need of <i>weakness</i>. The man of faith, the
                “believer” of any sort, is necessarily a dependent man—such a man
                cannot posit <i>himself</i> as a goal, nor can he find goals within himself.
                The “believer” does not belong to himself; he can only be a means to an
                end; he must be <i>used up</i>; he needs some one to use him up. His instinct
                gives the highest honours to an ethic of self-effacement; he is prompted
                to embrace it by everything: his prudence, his experience, his vanity.
                Every sort of faith is in itself an evidence of self-effacement, of
                self-estrangement.... When one reflects how necessary it is to the great
                majority that there be regulations to restrain them from without and
                hold them fast, and to what extent control, or, in a higher sense,
                <i>slavery</i>, is the one and only condition which makes for the well-being
                of the weak-willed man, and especially woman, then one at once
                understands conviction and “faith.” To the man with convictions they are
                his backbone. To <i>avoid</i> seeing many things, to be impartial about
                nothing, to be a party man through and through, to estimate all values
                strictly and infallibly—these are conditions necessary to the existence
                of such a man.<span class="pagenum" title="Page 155"> </span><a id="Page_155"></a> But by the same token they are <i>antagonists</i> of the
                truthful man—of the truth.... The believer is not free to answer the
                question, “true” or “not true,” according to the dictates of his own
                conscience: integrity on <i>this</i> point would work his instant downfall.
                The pathological limitations of his vision turn the man of convictions
                into a fanatic—Savonarola, Luther, Rousseau, Robespierre,
                Saint-Simon—these types stand in opposition to the strong,
                <i>emancipated</i> spirit. But the grandiose attitudes of these <i>sick</i>
                intellects, these intellectual epileptics, are of influence upon the
                great masses—fanatics are picturesque, and mankind prefers observing
                poses to listening to <i>reasons</i>....</p>
                <h3>55.</h3>
                <p>—One step further in the psychology of conviction, of “faith.” It is
                now a good while since I first proposed for consideration the question
                whether convictions are not even more dangerous enemies to truth than
                lies. (“Human, All-Too-Human,” I, aphorism 483.)<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27_27">[27]</a> This time I desire
                to put the question definitely: is there<span class="pagenum" title="Page 156"> </span><a id="Page_156"></a> any actual difference between
                a lie and a conviction?—All the world believes that there is; but what
                is not believed by all the world!—Every conviction has its history, its
                primitive forms, its stage of tentativeness and error: it <i>becomes</i> a
                conviction only after having been, for a long time, <i>not</i> one, and then,
                for an even longer time, <i>hardly</i> one. What if falsehood be also one of
                these embryonic forms of conviction?—Sometimes all that is needed is a
                change in persons: what was a lie in the father becomes a conviction in
                the son.—I call it lying to refuse to see what one sees, or to refuse
                to see it <i>as</i> it is: whether the lie be uttered before witnesses or not
                before witnesses is of no consequence. The most common sort of lie is
                that by which a man deceives himself: the deception of others is a
                relatively rare offence.—Now, this will <i>not</i> to see what one sees,
                this will <i>not</i> to see it as it is, is almost the first requisite for
                all who belong to a party of whatever sort: the party man becomes
                inevitably a liar. For example, the German historians are convinced that
                Rome was synonymous with despotism and that the Germanic peoples brought
                the spirit of liberty into the world: what is the difference between
                this conviction and a<span class="pagenum" title="Page 157"> </span><a id="Page_157"></a> lie? Is it to be wondered at that all partisans,
                including the German historians, instinctively roll the fine phrases of
                morality upon their tongues—that morality almost owes its very
                <i>survival</i> to the fact that the party man of every sort has need of it
                every moment?—“This is <i>our</i> conviction: we publish it to the whole
                world; we live and die for it—let us respect all who have
                convictions!”—I have actually heard such sentiments from the mouths of
                anti-Semites. On the contrary, gentlemen! An anti-Semite surely does not
                become more respectable because he lies on principle.... The priests,
                who have more finesse in such matters, and who well understand the
                objection that lies against the notion of a conviction, which is to say,
                of a falsehood that becomes a matter of principle <i>because</i> it serves a
                purpose, have borrowed from the Jews the shrewd device of sneaking in
                the concepts, “God,” “the will of God” and “the revelation of God” at
                this place. Kant, too, with his categorical imperative, was on the same
                road: this was his <i>practical</i> reason.<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28_28">[28]</a> There are questions regarding
                the truth or untruth of which it is <i>not</i><span class="pagenum" title="Page 158"> </span><a id="Page_158"></a> for man to decide; all the
                capital questions, all the capital problems of valuation, are beyond
                human reason.... To know the limits of reason—<i>that</i> alone is genuine
                philosophy.... Why did God make a revelation to man? Would God have done
                anything superfluous? Man <i>could</i> not find out for himself what was good
                and what was evil, so God taught him His will.... Moral: the priest does
                <i>not</i> lie—the question, “true” or “untrue,” has nothing to do with such
                things as the priest discusses; it is impossible to lie about these
                things. In order to lie here it would be necessary to know <i>what</i> is
                true. But this is more than man <i>can</i> know; therefore, the priest is
                simply the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original read ‘mouth-piece.’">mouthpiece</ins> of God.—Such a priestly syllogism
                is by no means merely Jewish and Christian; the right to lie and the
                <i>shrewd dodge</i> of “revelation” belong to the general priestly type—to
                the priest of the <i>décadence</i> as well as to the priest of pagan times
                (—Pagans are all those who say yes to life, and to whom “God” is a word
                signifying acquiescence in all things).—The “law,” the “will of God,”
                the “holy book,” and “inspiration”—all these things are merely words
                for the conditions <i>under</i> which the priest comes to power and <i>with</i>
                which he<span class="pagenum" title="Page 159"> </span><a id="Page_159"></a> maintains his power,—these concepts are to be found at the
                bottom of all priestly organizations, and of all priestly or
                priestly-philosophical schemes of governments. The “holy lie”—common
                alike to Confucius, to the Code of Manu, to Mohammed and to the
                Christian church—is not even wanting in Plato. “Truth is here”: this
                means, no matter where it is heard, <i>the priest lies</i>....</p>

                <h3>56.</h3>
                <p>—In the last analysis it comes to this: what is the <i>end</i> of lying? The
                fact that, in Christianity, “holy” ends are not visible is <i>my</i>
                objection to the means it employs. Only <i>bad</i> ends appear: the
                poisoning, the calumniation, the denial of life, the despising of the
                body, the degradation and self-contamination of man by the concept of
                sin—<i>therefore</i>, its means are also bad.—I have a contrary feeling
                when I read the Code of Manu, an incomparably more intellectual and
                superior work, which it would be a sin against the <i>intelligence</i> to so
                much as <i>name</i> in the same breath with the Bible. It is easy to see why:
                there is a genuine philosophy behind it, <i>in</i> it, not merely an
                evil-smelling mess of Jewish rabbinism and<span class="pagenum" title="Page 160"> </span><a id="Page_160"></a> superstition,—it gives even
                the most fastidious psychologist something to sink his teeth into. And,
                <i>not</i> to forget what is most important, it differs fundamentally from
                every kind of Bible: by means of it the <i>nobles</i>, the philosophers and
                the warriors keep the whip-hand over the majority; it is full of noble
                valuations, it shows a feeling of perfection, an acceptance of life, and
                triumphant feeling toward self and life—the <i>sun</i> shines upon the whole
                book.—All the things on which Christianity vents its fathomless
                vulgarity—for example, procreation, women and marriage—are here
                handled earnestly, with reverence and with love and confidence. How can
                any one really put into the hands of children and ladies a book which
                contains such vile things as this: “to avoid fornication, let every man
                have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband; ... it is
                better to marry than to burn”?<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29_29">[29]</a> And is it <i>possible</i> to be a
                Christian so long as the origin of man is Christianized, which is to
                say, <i>befouled</i>, by the doctrine of the <i>immaculata conceptio</i>?... I
                know of no book in which so many delicate and kindly things are said of
                women as in the Code of Manu; these old<span class="pagenum" title="Page 161"> </span><a id="Page_161"></a> grey-beards and saints have a
                way of being gallant to women that it would be impossible, perhaps, to
                surpass. “The mouth of a woman,” it says in one place, “the breasts of a
                maiden, the prayer of a child and the smoke of sacrifice are always
                pure.” In another place: “there is nothing purer than the light of the
                sun, the shadow cast by a cow, air, water, fire and the breath of a
                maiden.” Finally, in still another place—perhaps this is also a holy
                lie—: “all the orifices of the body above the navel are pure, and all
                below are impure. Only in the maiden is the whole body pure.”</p>
                <div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_29_29"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_29_29" class="pginternal">[29]</a></span> <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original read ‘I.’">1</ins> Corinthians vii, 2, 9.</p></div>
                <h3>57.</h3>
                <p>One catches the <i>unholiness</i> of Christian means <i>in flagranti</i> by the
                simple process of putting the ends sought by Christianity beside the
                ends sought by the Code of Manu—by putting these enormously
                antithetical ends under a strong light. The critic of Christianity
                cannot evade the necessity of making Christianity <i>contemptible</i>.—A
                book of laws such as the Code of Manu has the same origin as every other
                good law-book: it epitomizes the experience, the sagacity and the
                ethical experimentation of long centuries; it brings<span class="pagenum" title="Page 162"> </span><a id="Page_162"></a> things to a
                conclusion; it no longer creates. The prerequisite to a codification of
                this sort is recognition of the fact that the means which establish the
                authority of a slowly and painfully attained <i>truth</i> are fundamentally
                different from those which one would make use of to prove it. A law-book
                never recites the utility, the grounds, the casuistical antecedents of a
                law: for if it did so it would lose the imperative tone, the “thou
                shall,” on which obedience is based. The problem lies exactly here.—At
                a certain point in the evolution of a people, the class within it of the
                greatest insight, which is to say, the greatest hindsight and foresight,
                declares that the series of experiences determining how all shall
                live—or <i>can</i> live—has come to an end. The object now is to reap as
                rich and as complete a harvest as possible from the days of experiment
                and <i>hard</i> experience. In consequence, the thing that is to be avoided
                above everything is further experimentation—the continuation of the
                state in which values are fluent, and are tested, chosen and criticized
                <i>ad infinitum</i>. Against this a double wall is set up: on the one hand,
                <i>revelation</i>, which is the assumption that the reasons lying behind the
                laws are <i>not</i> of human origin, that they were <i>not</i> sought<span class="pagenum" title="Page 163"> </span><a id="Page_163"></a> out and
                found by a slow process and after many errors, but that they are of
                divine ancestry, and came into being complete, perfect, without a
                history, as a free gift, a miracle...; and on the other hand,
                <i>tradition</i>, which is the assumption that the law has stood unchanged
                from time immemorial, and that it is impious and a crime against one’s
                forefathers to bring it into question. The authority of the law is thus
                grounded on the thesis: God gave it, and the fathers <i>lived</i> it.—The
                higher motive of such procedure lies in the design to distract
                consciousness, step by step, from its concern with notions of right
                living (that is to say, those that have been <i>proved</i> to be right by
                wide and carefully considered experience), so that instinct attains to a
                perfect automatism—a primary necessity to every sort of mastery, to
                every sort of perfection in the art of life. To draw up such a law-book
                as Manu’s means to lay before a people the possibility of future
                mastery, of attainable perfection—it permits them to aspire to the
                highest reaches of the art of life. <i>To that end the thing must be made
                unconscious</i>: that is the aim of every holy lie.—The <i>order of castes</i>,
                the highest, the dominating law, is merely the ratification of an <i>order
                of nature</i>, of a natural<span class="pagenum" title="Page 164"> </span><a id="Page_164"></a> law of the first rank, over which no arbitrary
                fiat, no “modern idea,” can exert any influence. In every healthy
                society there are three physiological types, gravitating toward
                differentiation but mutually conditioning one another, and each of these
                has its own hygiene, its own sphere of work, its own special mastery and
                feeling of perfection. It is <i>not</i> Manu but nature that sets off in one
                class those who are chiefly intellectual, in another those who are
                marked by muscular strength and temperament, and in a third those who
                are distinguished in neither one way or the other, but show only
                mediocrity—the last-named represents the great majority, and the first
                two the select. The superior caste—I call it the <i>fewest</i>—has, as the
                most perfect, the privileges of the few: it stands for happiness, for
                beauty, for everything good upon earth. Only the most intellectual of
                men have any right to beauty, to the beautiful; only in them can
                goodness escape being weakness. <i>Pulchrum est paucorum hominum</i>:<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30_30">[30]</a>
                goodness is a privilege. Nothing could be more unbecoming to them than
                uncouth manners or a pessimistic look, or an eye that sees
                <i>ugliness</i>—or indignation against the general aspect of things.
                Indigna<span class="pagenum" title="Page 165"> </span><a id="Page_165"></a>tion is the privilege of the Chandala; so is pessimism. “<i>The
                world is perfect</i>”—so prompts the instinct of the intellectual, the
                instinct of the man who says yes to life. “Imperfection, whatever is
                <i>inferior</i> to us, distance, the pathos of distance, even the Chandala
                themselves are parts of this perfection.” The most intelligent men, like
                the <i>strongest</i>, find their happiness where others would find only
                disaster: in the labyrinth, in being hard with themselves and with
                others, in effort; their delight is in self-mastery; in them asceticism
                becomes second nature, a necessity, an instinct. They regard a difficult
                task as a privilege; it is to them a <i>recreation</i> to play with burdens
                that would crush all others.... Knowledge—a form of asceticism.—They
                are the most honourable kind of men: but that does not prevent them
                being the most cheerful and most amiable. They rule, not because they
                want to, but because they <i>are</i>; they are not at liberty to play
                second.—The <i>second caste</i>: to this belong the guardians of the law,
                the keepers of order and security, the more noble warriors, above all,
                the king as the highest form of warrior, judge and preserver of the law.
                The second in rank constitute the executive arm of the intellectuals,
                the<span class="pagenum" title="Page 166"> </span><a id="Page_166"></a> next to them in rank, taking from them all that is <i>rough</i> in the
                business of ruling—their followers, their right hand, their most apt
                disciples.—In all this, I repeat, there is nothing arbitrary, nothing
                “made up”; whatever is to the <i>contrary</i> is made up—by it nature is
                brought to shame.... The order of castes, the <i>order of rank</i>, simply
                formulates the supreme law of life itself; the separation of the three
                types is necessary to the maintenance of society, and to the evolution
                of higher types, and the highest types—the <i>inequality</i> of rights is
                essential to the existence of any rights at all.—A right is a
                privilege. Every one enjoys the privileges that accord with his state of
                existence. Let us not underestimate the privileges of the <i>mediocre</i>.
                Life is always harder as one mounts the <i>heights</i>—the cold increases,
                responsibility increases. A high civilization is a pyramid: it can stand
                only on a broad base; its primary prerequisite is a strong and soundly
                consolidated mediocrity. The handicrafts, commerce, agriculture,
                <i>science</i>, the greater part of art, in brief, the whole range of
                <i>occupational</i> activities, are compatible only with mediocre ability and
                aspiration; such callings would be out of place for exceptional men; the
                instincts<span class="pagenum" title="Page 167"> </span><a id="Page_167"></a> which belong to them stand as much opposed to aristocracy as
                to anarchism. The fact that a man is publicly useful, that he is a
                wheel, a function, is evidence of a natural predisposition; it is not
                <i>society</i>, but the only sort of happiness that the majority are capable
                of, that makes them intelligent machines. To the mediocre mediocrity is
                a form of happiness; they have a natural instinct for mastering one
                thing, for specialization. It would be altogether unworthy of a profound
                intellect to see anything objectionable in mediocrity in itself. It is,
                in fact, the <i>first</i> prerequisite to the appearance of the exceptional:
                it is a necessary condition to a high degree of civilization. When the
                exceptional man handles the mediocre man with more delicate fingers than
                he applies to himself or to his equals, this is not merely kindness of
                heart—it is simply his <i>duty</i>.... Whom do I hate most heartily among
                the rabbles of today? The rabble of Socialists, the apostles to the
                Chandala, who undermine the workingman’s instincts, his pleasure, his
                feeling of contentment with his petty existence—who make him envious
                and teach him revenge.... Wrong never lies in unequal rights; it lies in
                the assertion of “equal” rights.... What is <i>bad</i>? But I have<span class="pagenum" title="Page 168"> </span><a id="Page_168"></a> already
                answered: all that proceeds from weakness, from envy, from
                <i>revenge</i>.—The anarchist and the Christian have the same ancestry....</p>

                <p>In point of fact, the end for which one lies makes a great difference:
                whether one preserves thereby or destroys. There is a perfect likeness
                between Christian and anarchist: their object, their instinct, points
                only toward destruction. One need only turn to history for a proof of
                this: there it appears with appalling distinctness. We have just studied
                a code of religious legislation whose object it was to convert the
                conditions which cause life to <i>flourish</i> into an “eternal” social
                organization,—Christianity found its mission in putting an end to such
                an organization, <i>because life flourished under it</i>. There the benefits
                that reason had produced during long ages of experiment and insecurity
                were applied to the most remote uses, and an effort was made to bring in
                a harvest that should be as large, as rich and as complete as possible;
                here, on the contrary, the harvest is <i>blighted</i> overnight.... That
                which stood there <i>aere perennis</i>, the <i>imperium Romanum</i>, the most
                magnificent form of<span class="pagenum" title="Page 169"> </span><a id="Page_169"></a> organization under difficult conditions that has
                ever been achieved, and compared to which everything before it and after
                it appears as patchwork, bungling, <i>dilletantism</i>—those holy anarchists
                made it a matter of “piety” to destroy “the world,” <i>which is to say</i>,
                the <i>imperium Romanum</i>, so that in the end not a stone stood upon
                another—and even Germans and other such louts were able to become its
                masters.... The Christian and the anarchist: both are <i>décadents</i>; both
                are incapable of any act that is not disintegrating, poisonous,
                degenerating, <i>blood-sucking</i>; both have an instinct of <i>mortal hatred</i>
                of everything that stands up, and is great, and has durability, and
                promises life a future.... Christianity was the vampire of the <i>imperium
                Romanum</i>,—overnight it destroyed the vast achievement of the Romans:
                the conquest of the soil for a great culture <i>that could await its
                time</i>. Can it be that this fact is not yet understood? The <i>imperium
                Romanum</i> that we know, and that the history of the Roman provinces
                teaches us to know better and better,—this most admirable of all works
                of art in the grand manner was merely the beginning, and the structure
                to follow was not to <i>prove</i> its worth for thousands of years. To this
                day, noth<span class="pagenum" title="Page 170"> </span><a id="Page_170"></a>ing on a like scale <i>sub specie aeterni</i> has been brought into
                being, or even dreamed of!—This organization was strong enough to
                withstand bad emperors: the accident of personality has nothing to do
                with such things—the <i>first</i> principle of all genuinely great
                architecture. But it was not strong enough to stand up against the
                <i>corruptest</i> of all forms of corruption—against Christians.... These
                stealthy worms, which under the cover of night, mist and duplicity,
                crept upon every individual, sucking him dry of all earnest interest in
                <i>real</i> things, of all instinct for <i>reality</i>—this cowardly, effeminate
                and sugar-coated gang gradually alienated all “souls,” step by step,
                from that colossal edifice, turning against it all the meritorious,
                manly and noble natures that had found in the cause of Rome their own
                cause, their own serious purpose, their own <i>pride</i>. The sneakishness of
                hypocrisy, the secrecy of the conventicle, concepts as black as hell,
                such as the sacrifice of the innocent, the <i>unio mystica</i> in the
                drinking of blood, above all, the slowly rekindled fire of revenge, of
                Chandala revenge—all <i>that</i> sort of thing became master of Rome: the
                same kind of religion which, in a pre-existent form, Epicurus had
                combatted. One has but to<span class="pagenum" title="Page 171"> </span><a id="Page_171"></a> read Lucretius to know <i>what</i> Epicurus made
                war upon—<i>not</i> paganism, but “Christianity,” which is to say, the
                corruption of souls by means of the concepts of guilt, punishment and
                immortality.—He combatted the <i>subterranean</i> cults, the whole of latent
                Christianity—to deny immortality was already a form of genuine
                <i>salvation</i>.—Epicurus had triumphed, and every respectable intellect in
                Rome was Epicurean—<i>when Paul appeared</i> ... Paul, the Chandala hatred
                of Rome, of “the world,” in the flesh and inspired by genius—the Jew,
                the <i>eternal</i> Jew <i>par excellence</i>.... What he saw was how, with the aid
                of the small sectarian Christian movement that stood apart from Judaism,
                a “world conflagration” might be kindled; how, with the symbol of “God
                on the cross,” all secret seditions, all the fruits of anarchistic
                intrigues in the empire, might be amalgamated into one immense power.
                “Salvation is of the Jews.”—Christianity is the formula for exceeding
                <i>and</i> summing up the subterranean cults of all varieties, that of
                Osiris, that of the Great Mother, that of Mithras, for instance: in his
                discernment of this fact the genius of Paul showed itself. His instinct
                was here so sure that, with reckless violence to the truth, he put<span class="pagenum" title="Page 172"> </span><a id="Page_172"></a> the
                ideas which lent fascination to every sort of Chandala religion into the
                mouth of the “Saviour” as his own inventions, and not only into the
                mouth—he <i>made</i> out of him something that even a priest of Mithras
                could understand.... This was his revelation at Damascus: he grasped the
                fact that he <i>needed</i> the belief in immortality in order to rob “the
                world” of its value, that the concept of “hell” would master Rome—that
                the notion of a “beyond” is the <i>death of life</i>.... Nihilist and
                Christian: they rhyme in German, and they do more than rhyme....</p>

                <p>The whole labour of the ancient world gone for <i>naught</i>: I have no word
                to describe the feelings that such an enormity arouses in me.—And,
                considering the fact that its labour was merely preparatory, that with
                adamantine self-consciousness it laid only the foundations for a work to
                go on for thousands of years, the whole <i>meaning</i> of antiquity
                disappears!... To what end the Greeks? to what end the Romans?—All the
                prerequisites to a learned culture, all the <i>methods</i> of science, were
                already there; man had already perfected the great and incomparable art
                of read<span class="pagenum" title="Page 173"> </span><a id="Page_173"></a>ing profitably—that first necessity to the tradition of
                culture, the unity of the sciences; the natural sciences, in alliance
                with mathematics and mechanics, were on the right road,—<i>the sense of
                fact</i>, the last and more valuable of all the senses, had its schools,
                and its traditions were already centuries old! Is all this properly
                understood? Every <i>essential</i> to the beginning of the work was
                ready:—and the <i>most</i> essential, it cannot be said too often, are
                methods, and also the most difficult to develop, and the longest opposed
                by habit and laziness. What we have today reconquered, with unspeakable
                self-discipline, for ourselves—for certain bad instincts, certain
                Christian instincts, still lurk in our bodies—that is to say, the keen
                eye for reality, the cautious hand, patience and seriousness in the
                smallest things, the whole <i>integrity</i> of knowledge—all these things
                were already there, and had been there for two thousand years! <i>More</i>,
                there was also a refined and excellent tact and taste! <i>Not</i> as mere
                brain-drilling! <i>Not</i> as “German” culture, with its loutish manners! But
                as body, as bearing, as instinct—in short, as reality.... <i>All gone for
                naught!</i> Overnight it became merely a memory!—The Greeks! The Romans!<span class="pagenum" title="Page 174"> </span><a id="Page_174"></a>
                Instinctive nobility, taste, methodical inquiry, genius for organization
                and administration, faith in and the <i>will</i> to secure the future of man,
                a great yes to everything entering into the <i>imperium Romanum</i> and
                palpable to all the senses, a grand style that was beyond mere art, but
                had become reality, truth, <i>life</i>....—All overwhelmed in a night, but
                not by a convulsion of nature! Not trampled to death by Teutons and
                others of heavy hoof! But brought to shame by crafty, sneaking,
                invisible, anæmic vampires! Not conquered,—only sucked dry!... Hidden
                vengefulness, petty envy, became <i>master</i>! Everything wretched,
                intrinsically ailing, and invaded by bad feelings, the whole
                <i>ghetto-world</i> of the soul, was at once <i>on top</i>!—One needs but read
                any of the Christian agitators, for example, St. Augustine, in order to
                realize, in order to smell, what filthy fellows came to the top. It
                would be an error, however, to assume that there was any lack of
                understanding in the leaders of the Christian movement:—ah, but they
                were clever, clever to the point of holiness, these fathers of the
                church! What they lacked was something quite different. Nature
                neglected—perhaps forgot—to give them even the most<span class="pagenum" title="Page 175"> </span><a id="Page_175"></a> modest endowment
                of respectable, of upright, of <i>cleanly</i> instincts.... Between
                ourselves, they are not even men.... If Islam despises Christianity, it
                has a thousandfold right to do so: Islam at least assumes that it is
                dealing with <i>men</i>....</p>
                <h3>60.</h3>
                <p>Christianity destroyed for us the whole harvest of ancient civilization,
                and later it also destroyed for us the whole harvest of <i>Mohammedan</i>
                civilization. The wonderful culture of the Moors in Spain, which was
                fundamentally nearer to <i>us</i> and appealed more to our senses and tastes
                than that of Rome and Greece, was <i>trampled down</i> (—I do not say by
                what sort of feet—) Why? Because it had to thank noble and manly
                instincts for its origin—because it said yes to life, even to the rare
                and refined luxuriousness of Moorish life!... The crusaders later made
                war on something before which it would have been more fitting for them
                to have grovelled in the dust—a civilization beside which even that of
                our nineteenth century seems very poor and very “senile.”—What they
                wanted, of course, was booty: the orient was rich.... Let us put<span class="pagenum" title="Page 176"> </span><a id="Page_176"></a> aside
                our prejudices! The crusades were a higher form of piracy, nothing more!
                The German nobility, which is fundamentally a Viking nobility, was in
                its element there: the church knew only too well how the German nobility
                was to be <i>won</i>.... The German noble, always the “Swiss guard” of the
                church, always in the service of every bad instinct of the church—<i>but
                well paid</i>.... Consider the fact that it is precisely the aid of German
                swords and German blood and valour that has enabled the church to carry
                through its war to the death upon everything noble on earth! At this
                point a host of painful questions suggest themselves. The German
                nobility stands <i>outside</i> the history of the higher civilization: the
                reason is obvious.... Christianity, alcohol—the two <i>great</i> means of
                corruption.... Intrinsically there should be no more choice between
                Islam and Christianity than there is between an Arab and a Jew. The
                decision is already reached; nobody remains at liberty to choose here.
                Either a man is a Chandala or he is not.... “War to the knife with Rome!
                Peace and friendship with Islam!”: this was the feeling, this was the
                <i>act</i>, of that great free spirit, that genius among German emperors,
                Frederick<span class="pagenum" title="Page 177"> </span><a id="Page_177"></a> II. What! must a German first be a genius, a free spirit,
                before he can feel <i>decently</i>? I can’t make out how a German could ever
                feel <i>Christian</i>....</p>
                <h3>61.</h3>
                <p>Here it becomes necessary to call up a memory that must be a hundred
                times more painful to Germans. The Germans have destroyed for Europe the
                last great harvest of civilization that Europe was ever to reap—the
                <i>Renaissance</i>. Is it understood at last, <i>will</i> it ever be understood,
                <i>what</i> the Renaissance was? <i>The transvaluation of Christian
                values</i>,—an attempt with all available means, all instincts and all the
                resources of genius to bring about a triumph of the <i>opposite</i> values,
                the more <i>noble</i> values.... This has been the one great war of the past;
                there has never been a more critical question than that of the
                Renaissance—it is <i>my</i> question too—; there has never been a form of
                <i>attack</i> more fundamental, more direct, or more violently delivered by a
                whole front upon the center of the enemy! To attack at the critical
                place, at the very seat of Christianity, and there enthrone the more
                noble values—that is to say, to <i>insinuate</i> them into the<span class="pagenum" title="Page 178"> </span><a id="Page_178"></a> instincts,
                into the most fundamental needs and appetites of those sitting there....
                I see before me the <i>possibility</i> of a perfectly heavenly enchantment
                and spectacle:—it seems to me to scintillate with all the vibrations of
                a fine and delicate beauty, and within it there is an art so divine, so
                infernally divine, that one might search in vain for thousands of years
                for another such possibility; I see a spectacle so rich in significance
                and at the same time so wonderfully full of paradox that it should
                arouse all the gods on Olympus to immortal laughter—<i>Cæsar Borgia as
                pope!</i>... Am I understood?... Well then, <i>that</i> would have been the
                sort of triumph that <i>I</i> alone am longing for today—: by it
                <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original read ‘Chrstianity.’">Christianity</ins> would have been <i>swept away</i>!—What
                happened? A German monk, Luther, came to Rome. This monk, with all the
                vengeful instincts of an unsuccessful priest in him, raised a rebellion
                <i>against</i> the Renaissance in Rome.... Instead of grasping, with profound
                thanksgiving, the miracle that had taken place: the conquest of
                Christianity at its <i>capital</i>—instead of this, his hatred was
                stimulated by the spectacle. A religious man thinks only of
                himself.—Luther saw only the <i>depravity</i> of the papacy at the very
                moment when the oppo<span class="pagenum" title="Page 179"> </span><a id="Page_179"></a>site was becoming apparent: the old corruption, the
                <i>peccatum originale</i>, Christianity itself, no longer occupied the papal
                chair! Instead there was life! Instead there was the triumph of life!
                Instead there was a great yea to all lofty, beautiful and daring
                things!... And Luther <i>restored the church</i>: he attacked it.... The
                Renaissance—an event without meaning, a great futility!—Ah, these
                Germans, what they have not cost us! <i>Futility</i>—that has always been
                the work of the Germans.—The Reformation; <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original read ‘Liebnitz.’">Leibnitz</ins>; Kant
                and so-called German philosophy; the war of “liberation”; the
                empire—every time a futile substitute for something that once existed,
                for something <i>irrecoverable</i>.... These Germans, I confess, are my
                enemies: I despise all their uncleanliness in concept and valuation,
                their cowardice before every honest yea and nay. For nearly a thousand
                years they have tangled and confused everything their fingers have
                touched; they have on their conscience all the half-way measures, all
                the three-eighths-way measures, that Europe is sick of,—they also have
                on their conscience the uncleanest variety of Christianity that exists,
                and the most incurable and indestructible—Protestantism.... If man<span class="pagenum" title="Page 180"> </span><a id="Page_180"></a>kind
                never manages to get rid of Christianity the <i>Germans</i> will be to
                blame....</p>
                <h3>62.</h3>
                <p>—With this I come to a conclusion and pronounce my judgment. I
                <i>condemn</i> Christianity; I bring against the Christian church the most
                terrible of all the accusations that an accuser has ever had in his
                mouth. It is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable corruptions; it
                seeks to work the ultimate corruption, the worst possible corruption.
                The Christian church has left nothing untouched by its depravity; it has
                turned every value into worthlessness, and every truth into a lie, and
                every integrity into baseness of soul. Let any one dare to speak to me
                of its “humanitarian” blessings! Its deepest necessities range it
                against any effort to abolish distress; it lives by distress; it
                <i>creates</i> distress to make <i>itself</i> immortal.... For example, the worm
                of sin: it was the church that first enriched mankind with this
                misery!—The “equality of souls before God”—this fraud, this <i>pretext</i>
                for the <i>rancunes</i> of all the base-minded—this explosive concept,
                ending in revolution, the modern idea, and the notion of overthrowing
                the whole social order<span class="pagenum" title="Page 181"> </span><a id="Page_181"></a>—this is <i>Christian</i> dynamite.... The
                “humanitarian<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber’s note: Original omitted the closing quotation mark.">”</ins> blessings of Christianity forsooth! To breed out of
                <i>humanitas</i> a self-contradiction, an art of self-pollution, a will to
                lie at any price, an aversion and contempt for all good and honest
                instincts! All this, to me, is the “humanitarianism” of
                Christianity!—Parasitism as the <i>only</i> practice of the church; with its
                anæmic and “holy” ideals, sucking all the blood, all the love, all the
                hope out of life; the beyond as the will to deny all reality; the cross
                as the distinguishing mark of the most subterranean conspiracy ever
                heard of,—against health, beauty, well-being, intellect, <i>kindness</i> of
                soul—<i>against life itself</i>....</p>
                <p>This eternal accusation against Christianity I shall write upon all
                walls, wherever walls are to be found—I have letters that even the
                blind will be able to see.... I call Christianity the one great curse,
                the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct of revenge,
                for which no means are venomous enough, or secret, subterranean and
                <i>small</i> enough,—I call it the one immortal blemish upon the human
                race....</p>
                <p>And mankind reckons <i>time</i> from the <i>dies nefastus</i> when this fatality
                befell—from the <i>first</i><span class="pagenum" title="Page 182"> </span><a id="Page_182"></a> day of Christianity!—<i>Why not rather from its
                last?</i>—<i>From today?</i>—The transvaluation of all values!...</p>

                1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™

                destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your

                1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
                used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
                agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
                things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
                even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
                paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project

                agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
                electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

                1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
                Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
                of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
                works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
                States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
                United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
                claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
                displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
                all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
                that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
                free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
                works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
                Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
                comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
                same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
                you share it without charge with others.
                </div><div>
                1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
                what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
                in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
                check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
                agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
                distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
                other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no

                from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
                the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
                forth in Section 3 below.

                </div><div>
                1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
                effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
                works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
                Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
                electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
                contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
                or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
                intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
                other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
                cannot be read by your equipment.
                </div><div>
                1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
                of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
                Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
                Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
                Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
                liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
                fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
                LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
                PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
                TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
                LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
                INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                DAMAGE.
                </div><div>
                1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
                defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
                receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
                written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
                received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
                with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
                with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
                lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
                or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
                opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
                the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
                without further opportunities to fix the problem.
                </div><div>
                1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

                OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
                LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
                </div><div>
                1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
                warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
                damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
                violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
                agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
                limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
                unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
                remaining provisions.
                </div><div>
                1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
                trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
                providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
                accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

                electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
                including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
                the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
                or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or

                Defect you cause.

                </div><div>
                Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
                electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
                computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
                exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
                from people in all walks of life.
                </div><div>
                Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
                assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
                goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
                remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
                Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
                and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
                generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
                Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

                Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
                Literary Archive Foundation
                </div><div>
                Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
                public support and donations to carry out its mission of
                increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
                freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
                array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
                ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
                status with the IRS.
                </div><div>
                The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
                charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
                States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
                considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
                with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
                where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
                DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
                visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
                </div><div>
                While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
                have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
                against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
                approach us with offers to donate.
                </div><div>
                International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
                any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
                outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

                Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
                methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

                </div><div>
                Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
                Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
                freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
                distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
                volunteer support.
                </div><div>
                Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
                editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
                the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
                necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
                edition.
